const fileContent = "So it's worth pointing out that British and American doctors and psychiatrists and whatnot were at the forefront of this. And there's a whole literature. You can actually find a lot of it still in archives from people like Charles Salaby, who people who argued for eugenics. And America had you had the Cold Spring Harbor. You had always different entities. And in many respects, the Germans were just catching up to what was already being advocated. So they just basically said, OK, well, we're going to, rather than have this, we're going to actually allow people to basically eugenize. And I don't see that that's, and that's, wouldn't be that surprising. However, again, the extent of it is very open to debate. And I just think it gets a lot of press where people saying, oh, it's awful. And then saying, and then being presented without any context saying that, you know, Germans are the only one doing it. No, they weren't. That it was it was multiple people. And most notably, as I said, the Swedes were doing that they were doing the same thing at the same time. Does that help? Yes. Thank you very much. I'd also add, sorry, that T4 is an excellent argument against the Holocaust because you have to remember the hypothetical is that they were using carbon monoxide canisters. And as you probably all know, carbon monoxide is an excellent gas to kill people. However, they're suggesting that basically they went from carbon monoxide, which was being, which is an alleged byproduct of Auschwitz, then to using cyclone B in Auschwitz, which is which is hitlessly inefficient by any standards. So you can either have T4, you can have the Holocaust, you can't have both. Make some. Thank you. The right. Hello there. I'd actually like to add one thing about action T4 and happening in other countries. You may want to look up the Supreme Court case, Buck versus Bell, in the early 1900s, where the Supreme Court ruled that it was legal to sterilize retarded people in the United States. So that was a pretty common thing. Carl, thank you very much for everything you do. I had a question about the attitudes of race in the founding of America by the founding fathers. They were in an awkward position historically because it was before Darwin. It was before even modern chemistry or anything like that. And now we're kind of in this awkward philosophical position because Thomas Jefferson said, all men are created equal, which today is that causes some issues. And I want to know what the attitudes were towards race by the founding fathers at the start of the country. Of a certain country, you mean Jews or do you mean the US? In the US, I don't think Jews were much of an issue at the founding of the country. No, they were not particularly no. But I would say that the thing about Jefferson is that a lot of his stuff, so basically he argued, Jefferson argued, for example, that slavery was not really wrong, but racial segregation was not really right. He didn't believe in race as we would understand it because basically the concept of race has changed somewhat. However, we have to remember that as long as the concept of race itself, as people talking about it, has been around since the ancient Greeks and the Romans, who were talking about, you know, Herodotus says, but it says about the Ethiopians. We have the Romans talking about that. We're talking about race. We have the Arabs talking about how black people are stupid. We have Europeans doing something similar with the American Indians. So it's not that race didn't exist or it was just it was seen differently. And also it's often a kind of misnomer to say that they didn't have a modern understanding of it because they kind of did. But what was different was they had this idea of, they had different theories about how it came about. Like, for example, was it originating in climate? Was it, what we would consider genetic, was it inherent? So they had all these kind of arguments going on pre-Darwin. And a lot of them were completely OK with what we consider racism today. Because at the end of the day, while they believe that a black person could be free and actually have actually owned slaves at the end, they also believe that black people were fundamentally not, they were not the same as anyone else. They were just OK, we will accept that they can do these things. But we don't want them around. Which is why Lincoln very famously had his policy to basically export all the blacks from the United States back to Africa, which is all part, which is then partially realized in the country we now know as Liberia. So when we talk about the founding fathers on race, basically they were not, they were pretty racist. They didn't believe in total human equality. Very few people did at the time. In reality, they often talk about it as if they did, but they didn't. And you kind of see that in how they treat slaves, the attitude of slaves. And you also see it in terms of even the abolitionists, they inherently believe that black people were inferior in some way, but they believed that they could be perfected, they could be brought up, they could be better educated, kind of like the white man's burden of Kipling. But kind of applied to a different time period. It's kind of similar with the British. And the British went into these places, went into different places like India, and they held racist racial views, but they didn't really apply them until it was realized much later on about... Karen, please do. Do you mind if I interject on one of the points you made? No, no, you can put your hand up and wait until he's finished speaking, man. Why would you interrupt him, man, while he's mid-sentence? Yeah, that's not how we run the show around here. Put your hands up if you want to speak and wait until someone is done speaking, and then you're called upon. That's fine, I'm pretty much done with that. There is a page from booklet, which does quite a good job of explaining the founding father's racial views, which is worth viewing if you want to understand it. Yeah, man, put your hand up, because they had guys on stage before you as well. Zeus, do you remember the order? Hey, bup-bup, I make next, the annihilation, nihilism. Was that Dil-jenice that just brought you down now? I just put my hand up. Yeah, that was him that butted in. Make your next. Okay, one time, please, let me speak. I am full white power. Please don't get me, man. One time, please, let me speak. This isn't the time for this shit, get off the stage. Man, I am full white power. I don't give a fuck. Next person, annihilism. Annihilism, you're next. All right, get off the stage. Dwight. Dwight Schrute, you're next. Oh, I just went. You did. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Take you off the stage now. Hey, I don't have anything pertinent to say, gentlemen. So I'll raise my hand a little bit later when I got something good to say for y'all, okay? You can come back up later. Yeah, well, you can get off the stage when, don't just sit on our stage. It's not how we do this around here. American Aryan, you're next. Hi there, first of all, white power. And secondly, I have basically two questions for Carl. So one is, what is the relationship in your mind between national socialism and Christianity? And do you think Hitler was a Christian, or did his views evolve over time and so on? I think it's very easily explained by saying that fundamentally, national socialism and Christianity, they are, you can argue they're two competing worldviews as some Christians did, but you can also say what national socialism would say is that Christianity is spiritual belief. And we judge based upon how you view your race. Not, so if someone says I'm a Christian, but if you're not Christian, if you're Christian, that's all that matters, then that's anti-white, that's anti-your race. Whereas if someone says I'm a Christian, but I put my people, say a pagan, a white pagan, above a black Christian, then that's not a problem. That's perfectly fine. It's all about how you want to approach it. And that's how they approach it. So basically the Protestants don't get massively sectarian with Catholics, Catholics don't get massively sectarian Protestants. You're all Germans, how do you can have an argument but be adults about it and don't go after each other continuously? So they kind of promote the kind of ecumenicalism because they're fundamentally opposed to, what is often called clericalism. However, Hitler's views, I think we've kind of cut from that before, were really deist. I mean, lapsed Christian, not the nomination of Christian maybe, but that's about the best you can go because from what everything he says and everything he does, he's not opposed to Christianity, but he also doesn't wants to make his government about Christianity, if you understand me. And that it's not about who follows the right theology, it's about who loves their race. Oh, right. Yeah, so Karen, that's fine. No, it's just, it's all about that rather than, it's kind of a paradigm shift. And it's massively big at the time because you have to remember that he's arguing with the DNVP, which is the original German Fascist Party, who were very pro-Protestant, but often had a lot of Catholics. You had the Catholic Center Party, who were very, very Catholic, who opposed anything Protestant or anything that didn't, or the Catholic Church didn't like. So you've got all this context going on in the background. And then you've also got the fact that the NSDAP thoroughly opposed atheism. I mean, to the point where while there's two known atheists in the high ranks of the NSDAP, that would be Goebbels and Bournemont. They were not very open about it. And we really know that from their own, later from what we know from them later. But you couldn't, for example, be an atheist in the SS. That was actually forbidden. You had to at the very least be what they call Godglaubisch. So you had to be a believer in God, or something of that kind. So you could either be, I don't know, could be a Christian, you could be a pagan. You could just say, I'm Godglaubisch, which basically means that I am a God believer, I'm de-deerst, or you could have an association of other things. So that's the essence of it. It's just, it's a paradigm shift that a lot of people have a problem making, not because of any fault of their own, but because they don't have the context of 1920s, 1930s, German-Volkisch thought to kind of give them that additional bit of, okay, well, actually the Germans are thinking in a different way here, because compared to like modern America, where there's a lot of people who will shout about Christianity, but not act very Christian. If you understand me. I want to get in here. I got a quick question for Carl. And Mike Koff, he says, he like makes a remark when he's like waking up to the Jew, and he says like, these are what they call God's chosen. Like God's chosen people, like scoffing, like, yeah, right. And then, you know, if he wasn't Christian at the time, or his views changed, then he decides to send them to Israel. It's kind of like almost like he's, like he's kind of like mocking their prophecy, I think. Have you ever looked at it like that? And I was wondering on top of that second question, with the God, how do you pronounce it? The Gottlob? Gottglabich. Gottglabich, okay. I was told that like the majority of the SS is Gottglabich, and they weren't necessarily Christian or pagan. Is that, can you answer that one too? Yeah, I can answer that one. I mean, I think it was like 25, 30% of Gottglabich, and a minority were pagan. Someone once wrote, I think the best way of putting it would be, there was a small minority of pagans in the SS, just that they were a bit like libertarians in the Republican Party. They're very, very noisy. So you'd hear a lot from them, but there wasn't a lot of them. Whereas the bulk of the rest were Christians, they're Catholics or Protestants. A great example of which is, it's not well known, but there was an entire battalion of Mininites who served in the SS, under the, in the Waffen SS as full-assessed members. So you get some idea, and for example, what was it, was it Charmagne, the French SS division was openly Catholic, but then conversely, you had SS Liebsten data, the bodyguard of Aleph Hitler, who rather famously smashed up, smashed up crucifixes as their way to indicate to the supply units where they were across Catholic France. Again, you've got a lot of different units doing a lot of different things. And so it's very hard to take a holistic say, the SS of pagan, the SS of Christian, the SS of this, but all we know is that the SS were anti-Jewish, and they basically put, they said, as long as you're as long as you're Aryan, that's all that matters. Yeah. Okay, but I'm wondering, like, because he's like that saying in my confluence, waking up to the Jew, he like scoffs and says, like, yeah, God's chosen, this is God's chosen. And like, if you really believe that they were God's chosen, I just think like handing over Israel like that or helping them get to Israel, kind of was like him going like, yeah, whatever the fuck you believe. Are you saying that like, Hitler was taught by his priests that they were God's chosen people? I know, I'm saying, I don't think Hitler bought into it at all. Okay. Because he grew up Catholic, Hitler grew up Catholic. Yeah, I'm saying, I think what happened is he eventually teaches views about Christianity. Because why would he hand over, if he felt that disgusted about this group of people, why would he hand over their land and be like, oh yeah, you're God's chosen, like continue doing your thing in this land that you need to occupy? It's almost like he did it like, seems like a big giant, like. Okay. Control. I don't know. Okay, so you're talking about, you're talking about the, I can't remember the agreement, the Havara agreement, if I'm not wrong. Okay, so, okay, Havara agreement. So first myth is that it comes from the, it comes from the US DAP, it doesn't, comes from 1932. Second myth is it was a Jewish-rated policy. No, it's not, it's an economic policy. It was floated in 1932 because in 1931, the German treasury had a shortage of foreign currency. So they figured, okay, well, we need to come up with different ways of getting foreign currency. How is that achieved? Well, in 1932, a Jew in Israel, a Jew in what we now call Israel was then Palestine, came up with this idea that basically the Germans, that they could help, the Germans could help German Jews who wanted to leave Germany to Israel. This then gets agreed in 1933, just the Germans come to, just the NSDAP come to power. And it began, it's originally thought of by the NSDAP as a dual policy, one of which it has, it has a positive thing of getting Jews out of Germany, but the actual bulk of the policy and the reason why they're doing it is economic, because the context is the world boycott of Jews against Germany, which the Germans have very neatly skewered in the early 1930s. However, it's still a problem for them, particularly in this time. So what happens is, so there's a series of things that occur, the SS under, with the SS expert on the Jews called Leopold von Mildenstein, he goes to Palestine, there's a coin that gets, there's a coin straight metal that gets touted out a lot from this, and he writes about it in De Angerith. So that's Gerbils's paper in 1934. However, he's then appointed to head the SS department to get rid of the German, to get rid of the Jews in 1935, but by 1936, he is thoroughly opposed to Zionism and Israel. Why? Because he's found out that basically that there's no point in this endeavor, because it's not having a side effect. And quite frankly, it's hindering German interests. And there is this whole then kerfuffle within the Third Reich's bureaucracy between one side, the SS and the German foreign ministry, basically arguing that this policy should be discontinued because it's causing problems with the Third Reich's diplomacy, particularly in regards to the Arab lands. But the German treasury, in the same time, is saying, well, we still need it because we still need the money. So Hitler eventually says, look, okay, we're gonna continue doing this just because we need the policy and it has an accidental benefit. However, we're also gonna start arming the Palestinians, which is what the Germans do. The Germans basically begin arming the Palestinians, sending the Jews who want to go to Palestine. But again, we have to bear in mind that basically when they came out of Germany, it's not that they came out with all their wealth, they came out with about 10% of it. So the Germans basically got huge amounts of money out of this policy. So Hitler didn't change his mind. What Hitler was doing was saying, well, if you want to leave, leave, get out. And it's not like the Germans had that as one policy. It's, there's a whole suite of policies going on at the same time. For example, there's discussions about the famous ones about Madagascar. There's one. I was just gonna ask you that. I was just gonna ask you that. Why did they scratch Madagascar? They couldn't, they couldn't get to it. Because remember, World War II, it started at this point. You can't really move people to Madagascar in the middle of World War II, because it's French territory in the South of Africa. You can't, they can't get to it. However, there's a bunch of different policies also being kicked around at the same time. For example, turning bits of, a bit of Poland into a Jewish, into a Jewish homeland. There's other ones turning a bit of Russia into Jewish homeland. There's even debates as to reviving the South American option and the African option being like Kenya. So again, if you put this all in context, Hitler was not saying that the chosen people, Hitler's saying, well, actually, and because it's come back to Hitler's points about the chosen people, what he actually says is, if it is or whatever created in my camp to exercise, then it would be the biggest nation of swindlers in the world. It'd be a Parisian swindler nation, which is completely right. That's what's turned out to be the case. So if we look at all this context, this is what's going on. And it goes on until early 1945. So the Germans have, the German put, knocked the Havargrin on the head in the beginning of the Second World War. But the Germans have all these policies going on, these debates going on, where to put the Jews till 1945. And again, that kind of knocks the Holocaust in the head because why the, why is the German foreign office and why the German policy experts having this massive debate around the Jewish question of what to do with them if they're in fact gassing them? It kind of begs the question, doesn't it? Tradition. Is there anything else? As I'm calling. Tradition Europa. Yo, I just came on to ask Carl a quick question, because it's not really talked about in NSDAP history or whatnot, Germany during the 1930s and 40s. I just like to hear your view on, how do you view their programs for helping the birth rates? Because I always see some mixed signals from like mainstream like historians saying, well, it worked a little bit, but not that successful. And when I'm looking at like some of the more apparent and like, you know, top few links about it, it seems like the birth rates only grew by 0.3 over the course of 15 years. And it wasn't so successful and it even fell like 1943 about a little bit. So I was curious, do you think that Germany failed in trying to raise the birth rates or there were complications and how could you see that used in today's world? I think what Germany had found out, if I'm honest, is that they had, you're right, they had an initial spike in birth rates in 1933 to the mid-30s, but then they began to normal, they began to sort of re-level and then go down a bit. In part because there's a lot of, because basically the realities of motherhood began to hit and there were some girls who said, I don't really want it, et cetera, et cetera. But the Germans were taking some measures to kind of deal with this. For example, the Germans, they made abortion, with a significant jail sentence. And then in 1933, which is what you mentioned, abortion was made a death penalty offense. So if you had an abortion as a German woman, you were subject to the death penalty. So it wasn't that there wasn't, it wasn't that they were unsuccessful per se, it was just that we don't really have enough time to say, yes, their pronateless policies worked, they didn't. My guess is they probably would have worked over time, given that, for example, in the post-war years, there was massive baby booms in Europe. As kind of we know, I think Ed Dutton's touched on this quite a lot about how that kind of works from an evolutionary point of view. So again, I just, I think, I don't think we've got enough data or information to kind of say yes or no, but there's a lot of people kind of like with the German elections, in 1992 and 1933, where they'll say, oh yes, but you know, didn't work. Well, we don't have enough information in this case to say yes it did or didn't. It appeared to be working, but whether it would have worked to the long term, we can't really say if I'm completely honest. Yeah, all right, thank you. Yeah, because some people are criticised like birth rates and all that, and they think like within the first few years, your birth rate should go up by like three points or something, which I find a bit ridiculous, but I felt like, you know, some years where it was like a bit slower, there are complications with the war, something perhaps that has a bit of a psychological effect on the people. Yeah, I mean, I mean, I would bring up the point that you are dealing with a time when you're looking around. And so from the early years, there's a lot of, there's a lot of, shall we say, hope, there's change, there's all these things. But then from about 37, when this kind of begins to go down, we begin to see a lot more, there's a lot of the clouds of war alluming, people aren't sure, people are having children, people are stressed, it's that classic thing. So you can't really say yes or no either way. There's a lot of people trying to find anything to beat, as it uses a stick to beat Hitler with, I think more than anything. Yeah, so thank you for your answer. Hey, Bro. Random Lales. Hey, yeah, I don't know how to pronounce it either. Yeah, so for Carl, you mentioned about Hitler being kind of like a deus type. I mean, I guess for me, that just sounds kind of vague. If anybody's kind of interested in it, it just seems like, oh deus, it seems, I don't know, it's not something to really pursue in particular. But I mean, I guess it seems like he did have an interest in nature and definitely, it's kind of the natural spirit, but I think a lot of it seems like it goes around kind of the idea of the nation and kind of the nation being the religion. Like Germany, German people, basically, the Volk or the Theod, Tuaoth, if you want to use different words, just kind of the tribe that you're born in, you die, just that natural, like elements of rebirth. Lost him. I kind of hit him either. Carl, did you kind of get what he was leading on to about? Yeah, I kind of did. I think it's just, I think it's right in the sense that Hitler was a deist, but yes, he's right to say, what is a deist? Deists, it's a believer in God, but basically it's saying the point of the nation, that the nation is more than just confessional politics. And that's why I would say to bring back about confessionalism because it's the context of all this, that he's saying that we are Germans first before we are Catholic Protestant, pagan, anything like that. And that basically we are, and that fundamentally we owe ourselves to our nation. And that's pretty much it. So I kind of take Hitler's awakening to the Jews. I don't want to say, maybe kind of similar to mine in the fact that I grew up learning that the Jews were the chosen people, Israel was prophecy, blah, blah, blah. And then one day it just hits you, you know, are these really, you know, what they say, quote unquote, God's chosen people are? And then you start to backtrack and goes through everything that you've been taught through your Christianity in your life. And I even reached that same point where I started digging back through, not only just scripture, but exploring the different gods and religious histories before Christianity even evolved, going even further back to Zoroastrianism, which the Aryan tribes, it was one of the first monotheistic religions of the Aryan tribes. And then going through history and, you know, learning how the Romans expelled them, how many times the Romans expelled the Jews, how the Romans felt about them, you know, how the Romans felt about the Christians, how they felt about the Pagans, how the Romans also adopted many of the tribes or cultures, gods that they had conquered as well. And so, you know, I kind of see it as, you know, he was raised Catholic and grew up with all these teachings and then watching them destroy his nation, how, you know, the Jews have basically subverted and destroyed America today, was just like a big wake-up call for him and a search for the truth instead of, you know, putting these people in such a high regard, you actually see them as disgusting and perverted and almost demonic like humanoids, you know? And so I see him as a search for the truth. And I mean, who ultimately really knows the truth, but someone who is a true seeker and that will constantly seek truth for the rest of their life. So, you know, I don't necessarily see him as a bad person per se, because then I would have to see myself as a bad person because I'm on that same quest of, you know, the Jews have subverted our society, our religion, everything. And I'm on the pursuit of truth for my people and to protect my people into the future generations of our children. So that's how I kind of see it. I had a lot of family that never really subscribed to a straight denomination, but they did believe that a God did exist. And whenever you touched on the fact that the SS didn't, you know, maybe a lot of them were pagans and doing the old trying to relive and bring back the history of the Germanic paganism stuff. As long as an Aryan person in that nation subscribed that there was a God, you know, in the separation of church and state, that was all that mattered, that you did care about your race and your folk. So that's kind of how I look at it, Carl. Would you kind of see that in a similar light as well? Yeah, very much so. To give you context of what Hitler thought, Hitler actually said in my camp that fundamentally his awakening came from, he began reading anti-Semitic pamphlets and he began to realize that what he was looking at was just basically that it was a proper, it was actually a real problem. But the book I would always tell people to read, if you're a seeker and you're trying to understand this and you're trying to understand also Hitler's views about where they came from, who influenced Hitler? It's a common, an outlet thing, but a lot of people don't really know. The best book I've ever come across that was originally actually on the back of early NSDAP membership cards was Theodore Fritches, The Riddle of the Jews' Success. And if you read it, what you'll find is a lot of mine camp is really prefigured by Theodore Fritches' work, who was a really, really popular anti-Jewish writer and nationalist in the late 19th, early 20th centuries in Germany. He's also played a major role in distributing the protocols of Zion. But he's basically, he's a person who you can see where it kind of comes from when you read it. Because people always say, Houston Stuart Chamberlain or something like that, which isn't really, okay, Hitler might have read Houston Stuart Chamberlain, but you can see very little of national socialism in Houston Stuart Chamberlain. Whereas if you read Theodore Fritches, you can see an awful lot of it. You can see the same logic, the same arguments. In fact, a lot of what Fritches Fritches says he gets from Werner Sombat, rather interestingly. So when we're looking at the past, we must understand that the myth of the chosen people is probably the most potent one. But also there's a lot of, the more you get into this, the more you'll find. For example, probably most people don't know that Jews were expelled from Rome in I think 134 BC. That's long before people thought they were, but we actually have a reference to them being expelled then, which is kind of odd. And people also are unaware that Jews probably probably started the Great Fire of Rome, much as they did as I previously mentioned, the Great Fire of London again. And they also started, we know they started the Great Fire of Chicago in 1871 rather interestingly. So again, we come back to the fact that when we look and we look back at these things and we try and understand these things, it's always you sort of kind of know where things come from, but also to know what they don't tell you in equations. Like they, for example, we kind of touched on it earlier, the fact that the Havara agreement, people don't put it in the context of the world Jewish boycott against Germany in 1923, but it's actually a key part of the context for why that even came about or why that happened. But they don't mention it because all of a sudden, then there are people that ask, well, what about this boycott? Why were they boycotting it? Because all of a sudden, then you realize the German, the famous German boycott of Germany, go to 1933, was a response to the Jewish boycott. Not the other way around. Interesting. Thank you. Hey guys, can you hear me? Yes. Yes. Okay. Sorry, I'm at work. Can you come back to me and like, see as the next day? Yeah, we'll skip you for now. Okay. Just put your hand back up so we don't put you down. Ray Lake. White power brothers. Carl, thanks for being in this space. I had a couple of questions. The first one is, how would you best combat the contention that natural socialism was like propped up or founded by capitalist elites? And then the second is, what is your take on the provenance of the protocols? All right. Which one, which one, do you want to answer first? Your choice. Well, first of all, there was a myth that the Germans were funded by bankers. And specifically Jewish bankers. David Irving mentions it because Bruning, who was the Catholic center party president in 1931, basically claimed this during his time in England in the 1940s. However, he never backed up his claim. He just said it. And the likelihood is this is actually a claim that comes from another source or is just settled by its rumor. Because people have dug into this quite a lot. And the two principal, there are three principal sources who argue for this capitalist connection. One is Fritz Thyssen in his book, I Paid Hitler from 1941, which is actually not written by Fritz Thyssen, is written by Churchill's private secretary. So it's not actually Fritz Thyssen's work. And we don't really use it as such. But it's a key part of this claim because he's the major person who is behind a lot of the Bush financed the Germans or whatever. Whereas the other ones are Otto Strasser who makes these sort of claims in the early to mid 1930s to the 1940s in his various different books such as such Hitler and I. But also to his biographer who's becomes quite famous called Douglas Reed. And so again, why is he writing them? Because he basically tried to split the NSDAP in 1932 along with his brother Gregor. And he created what became known as the Black Front, which was a more pro socialist as he would say, but actually more pro-Jewish as it turned out, variant of natural socialism. And basically he failed. And he then tried to make his living basically writing crap about Hitler. So for example, the Hitler who had might be peed on, he likes to be dominated by women. Hitler was a homosexual. A lot of this stuff comes from Otto Strasser from the same source. The other person who's a big into this is Ernst Hamstangl. Now he's genuinely an early friend of Hitler. But there was a problem. First of all, the British intelligence, very early fingered him as a liar. And so did American intelligence. They all kind of worked out, well, actually he's making stuff up as he goes along. And then, and there's another element to this in that part of the reason he may have left Germany quite early on, first of all, because he was completely ineffective. Second of all, because it's quite possible that Hitler had an affair with his wife, Helen Hathamstangl, in the late 20s, maybe mid 20s. And again, that kind of comes into the fact that a lot of people just think Hitler had one girlfriend, if a brown. In fact, we know of at least three, and we know he had others in Vienna in the before World War one, and we know of three other possibilities as well, that we don't have any evidence per se happened, that it happened, but we suspect and Helen Hathamstangl was one of them. Now, coming back to funding, we again know that we actually know where the NSDAP funding came from. But those are the three sources which are used to argue against, to argue that it's capitalist conspiracy. As a matter of fact, these were then tabulated by two American authors called, I can't remember the, I think it's James Poole and Suzanne Poole in a book called, I Financed Hitler. However, this very was very quickly debunked by John Henry Ashby Turner, who was an American historian, an American academic historian in German big businesses, that German big business in the rise of Hitler, where he then went through and said, actually, no, this is complete nonsense. That this is just not true. That basically the pools are making all this up using these sources. And he basically shows that, yes, the Germans, the German big business did have some play in the Jonathan's NSDAP, but there was some real context with this in that the German NSDAP was not the party of the German big business. That was the DNVP, the German big business. Sorry. What did you say? Sorry. Hello. You there, Carl? I can hear him. Sorry. Okay. It must have been my connection. I'm sorry. Okay. Sorry. So yes, so the actual party of German big business was the DNVP, the German National People's Party, which was the party that collapsed in 1929 during the Wall Street crash elections. So their big sponsor was a man named Alfred Hugenberg, who sometimes associated himself with the DNSDAP and others like the Stahlhelm, but it wasn't actually a major backer of them. A lot of the big donations, the NSDAP from big business come through Alfred Hugenberg. They don't come independent of him. So basically he ran a right wing slush fund for right wing politics. There was a left wing version of this run by a man named Willy Munsonberg, who is the man responsible for the myth that the Nazis created the Reichstag fire. But fundamentally all this money goes to the, some of this money goes to the NSDAP, that's true, but a lot of it didn't. A lot of it went to the DNVP, the Stahlhelm, et cetera. And a lot of this big business money only really comes about in 931 and to a lesser extent, 932. So we don't, so there's a lot of this mess about, but when, for example, the academic William Brugstein wrote in The Logic of Evil, 1988, he argued and pointed out that basically we know where the NSDAP donations come from, that like 80, 90% of it comes from very small donations from German workers, German small business owners, the classic people that the NSDAP was representing. And even a Jewish author named Arnold Sveeg in 1933 insulted and exiled, basically admitted that the NSDAP was funded by German workers and it was primarily voted by German workers, not by big capitalists running big businesses. So that's a little bit of that, but there is some great books on this. I've already mentioned Turner, but there's another book called Hitlass Fortune in 2004 by a British man called Chris Wheaton, where he goes from the other side and says, well, was Hitler personally rich? Where did Hitler personally get his money from? And he debunks a lot of myths in that as well. He goes after and says, basically, yes, Hitler has some private people who donated money to him, such as the famous Bechstein family, who were the piano manufacturers. The lady of the household was very, very keen on Hitler. He may have been one of his mistresses, we don't know. But that's essentially where the money come from, but Hitler wasn't rich. He based, most of his money came from, from sales of my camp later on. And even then it wasn't turned, he's a bit like Himmler in that Himmler had to take loans from the, from Martin Bormann, because he was so frugal and he wouldn't, he wasn't corrupt in the slightest. So yeah, it kind of gives you some idea that a lot of the myth, there's a lot of myths around this topic. I am going to write a more detailed article on this, that's just been doing. Hey, Carl, did that Bechstein lady, I understood that she was a financier and like a side piece. Oh yeah, she, but she, she never actually financed the NSDPA itself. She was, she, she, she gave money to Hitler to pay his living expenses. And the only thing that Fritz Steisen did that was really major was he was the guy who paid for the outfitting of the Brown house in Munich. That was the only thing that Fritz Steisen did that was really, really huge for the NSDPA. Yeah, I mean, to your point, I mean, my comp was wildly successful. I think it's all about timing of when it was successful. But yeah, he made a lot of money from my comp. It's one of the most best selling books of all time. Yep, along with the Bible. So coming back to your point about the protocols, what did you want to know about the protocols exactly? I had a quick question if you didn't mind me asking real quick. So I know that you're not an economist and that you're more of a historian, but we seem to run into roadblocks from time to time with people who are staunch capitalists that don't quite understand how the national socialism labor-backed economy work. Could you provide some elaboration on how an economy could function off of labor backing its currency? Okay, so a good point on this is to understand if you read the libertarian economists, so your Milton Friedman's, your Hayek's, whatever, you'll notice they cite a lot of what we might call distributist authors, people like Hillier Bellock, particularly Hillier Bellock's book, Economics for Helen, and where he basically summarizes a lot of economic theory and makes it very, very simple. But what the point of that is that Bellock is talking about how money works and how money is not actually, money is more of a concept and an agreed one of that, not just to something that can be whatever. So basically the concept pretty much was that the Germans went for autarky, which I'm sure you know, is basically self-sufficiency, but the Germans had a problem. With foreign currency, as we kind of talked about, with the Havara agreement and the origins of that and why they were so keen on keeping that around because it gave them a lot of extra foreign currency to trade in. But the entire point of a lay-backed economy is that rather than having it so that your back to put, so that your economic standard is based upon, we know the perceived value of your capital or the share price or whatever it is, it's all about how your company can help the nation, the nation, so to speak. So basically you rather than say, your company is worth X amount in the stock market, you're saying, well, actually, we're going to put the X amount of investment in this company because we think it's worth that, not because the share price, because that's worth it. Kind of like the difference between listed companies and nonlisted companies. In that listed companies often have this concept of what they're worth. Whereas nonlisted companies, they think completely differently. They don't think in terms of what's next quarter, what am I going to do? I've got to make this quarter as well so that I'm going to get fired by the shareholders. So it's kind of like you had this whole economy and working in a nonlisted company. They're not working to the benefit of the shareholder, they're working for the benefit of the company itself and they're trying to make the right decisions for the company. So they're backing what they say with productivity and goods. It's been termed before that the Germans were going for a kind of mercantilist economy where they would produce a lot of high quality goods and then sell them around the world to get the foreign currency to then buy what they needed back. In essence, that's what they were doing. They were engaging in what you people would call Keynesianism. They were spending a lot of money but the entire point of spending a lot of money was that they would get it back in spades in the long run because they'd be less vulnerable to economic shocks from other countries. For example, you have to remember this isn't the time just after the great, the war should crash. So we have a bunch of different economies doing something similar all at the same time with a new deal in the US doing something similar. So again, the responses are different but in essence, the Germans were trying to change how economics worked. They were trying to focus back away from massive enterprises. Instead, they were focusing on quite small enterprises. So typical SMEs like for example, Dares rather famous agricultural policy which argued that what you actually needed was bigger states and more sort of like small local producers in classic distribution style because this was argued by GK Heston, Hillier-Bellock and Arthur Pentie, excuse me, and in their own way at other times. So essentially what they're going away from is they're going away from speculative capital backing their economic actions towards classic, almost classic barter like saying, I will give you this if you give me that. And it kind of out paradigms it but also it asks the question of say, someone who's very pro-capitalism, what kind of capitalism are you pro? Are you pro big corporations? Or are you pro actual capitalism which is hyper-compestive small entities which are doing the best they can to reduce for the national economy but also to make money because by making money everyone wins in the end because there's greater employment, there's greater skills but at the same time, the workers are not treated badly. They're treated just as workers should be as in work is honored rather than creative treatment. It's kind of, I don't know, it's not a means to an end. It is something to be honored and treasured for what it is. If that makes any sense, I'm not an economist. It's not my background. So I think you shed a lot of light on the topic at least for myself. So I appreciate your insight brother. Thank you. Do I need to come back to the protocols? What is that? Other guys, second question you're talking about, Carol? Yeah. He's sent it to me. So second question was his opinion on the providence of the protocols. Okay. Providence of the protocols. So the protocols, okay, the providence often. Yes. First of all, the protocols text that we have is wrong. It's not the original text. It's heavily interpolated, heavily changed. It was changed around 1985 by Sergey Nilles. But we do have, we do have... Do you say 1985, girl? 1905, zero five. Oh five, gosh. Sorry, that's my thanks. It was changed around then. That's when the references to Freemasons were put in. That's when the famous Darwin Nietzsche, the Darwin Nietzsche quote was put in as well. So a lot of that is all junk. But we do have an original text of the protocols. That text is in the back of César de Micholus' the non-existent manuscript, which is basically a compilation of two different known protocols texts from 1903 and 1904. That's before the alterations are made. But the interesting thing about it is that the references to the actual things that we know it quotes is the Old Testament a lot. But it also quotes designers, so the Uden stat by Hursel. So that's another thing that a lot of people don't know. But as the providence of it, it's just that the text we have is wrong and there's a lot of it that's bad or badly translated. For example, there's the subterranean tunnels that you may or may not remember from the text, where it says that they're burying subterranean tunnels underneath the cities. And there's an awful lot of Jews who have shrieked about that over the years and said it's obviously a fraud. No one thought to check the translation. Because it turns out it's just a mistranslation of the Russian to English. It's just literally all that's actually being said is that they are subverting. That's it. It's just someone mistranslating it, unfortunately. That someone who may or may not have been Victor Marston, they send the bait as to whether or not he actually translated it or it was just a pen name of someone else. But I can speak more about that if you want, but it's up to you guys. Extra pollations. Thank you, Zeus. Hello to your panel and hello to Carl there. It's very interesting, fascinating to hear that the Jews invented arson as well, every single disaster. My question to you is it's kind of slightly a compound one. So here we go. When you mentioned that Hitler in the 20s, when he was writing about the Jews, he said that if the nation or a homeland for them, if the nation of Israel was created for them, it would be a place where all the world's international criminals can go and hide out and they control their operations from there. So then we've seen probably a lot of us have seen the coin where we have the Nazi, sorry, the Swastika on one side and the Minora on the other side. People then sometimes suspect that Hitler was doing them a great favor. And why would he then, there's apparent contradiction there, go ahead and do the very thing through the Havara agreement of helping them to create their own state. And then the compound part is, is that many people who were literally Hitler before I was have assured me that despite the fact that Hitler's grandfather changed his name from Aloysius Schuchelgruber, which sounds like Schuchelgraber to Hitler, and that his mother definitely wasn't impregnated by one of the Rothschilds. It seems to be that she worked for them in some capacity in one of their castles. So look, my attitude to it is, is that even if I was born a Jew, I would still feel the same about them just like say, Bobby Fisher would. So it doesn't really change anything for me, but I'd like to know what your information is on that. Could they assure me that none of it is true, but even if it was wouldn't change the thing for me, but could you tell me what's the veracity or what's the real story of the Schuchelgruber, a grandmother and grandfather, and why did Hitler go and create Israel if he knew that would be the very thing the Jews would want? Thank you. All right. So let's deal with the Hitler was a Jew myth first. It is a myth very much so. Okay, so the claim that he is Jewish comes from two sources, really. The one you're referring to is the Rothschild claim, which is that he was impregnated by a Jew named Frankenberger. So his grandfather was, his father was the son of a Jew named Frankenberger and his mother. However, where does this come from? This comes from his long-term associate, Hans Frank, in 1945. However, it's been widely commented on and the fact is, is two things. First of all, Frank was then in a current state of mental breakdown. He was literally ranting and raving about everything and he contradicts himself on this point in his own memoirs. He says Hitler's ancestry had been checked thoroughly and then all of a sudden later on he suddenly starts on with the Frankenberger thing. But also we know it's not true because historians have gone and dug. They've gone and said, okay, it was there a Jew named Frankenberger where Hitler was born or in the realm where Hitler was born. And the truth is, is that there is no evidence for it at all. That they don't, it doesn't appear. Nothing appears. So we know that's not true. Further, as to his name, the Schiegelgruber, that's just a fairly common Austro-German name. However, his actual grandfathers were the Hoodlers. And so he has an interesting history with the Hoodlers in that the Hoodlers were, they had, so one grandfather, his official grandfather didn't like Alois, his father. But his brother, Johann Neppelmull Kuttler, had a massively positive relationship with Alois and they actually think he was the real father and that was the cause of all that debate and why there was a problem. Now, coming back to the issue of the, the other element of this, which is the coin, the famous Anglif coin, this comes again, this comes from Leopold von Milstein's visit to Palestine in 1933. So in 1934 he writes articles about it in Anglif in 1934 and then he becomes head of the SS, Jewish section in 1935 and then he resigns in 1936, basically saying it's a failure. And, but you also have to remember that this is a time when Israel, there is no chance Israel can be great as far as anyone's concerned because this is Mandate Palestine. Yes, it's, yes, Jews are going there, but they're not the only one, they're not only going there and they're also the ones, they're not, they're not just going to be, they're not only, that's not only what's going on, they're going to America, they're going to Britain, they're going to, they're going anywhere, they've got a Fugui plan in Japan, you've got all sorts of things going on at the same time, these are the destinations. So it isn't a contradiction, it's just a lack of context, that's the problem. And again, it was a policy, the Havara was a policy that was in response to the World Jewish Boycott of Germany in 1933 and it was also conceived of before the Djerk before the Third Reich even became a thing in 1932. So that's some more context for you. Thank you Carl, yeah, I mean, it's a little bit unsatisfactory because one would like to think Hitler could see their plans taking shape and the Jews seem to know what they were doing, even if Hitler didn't. It's a great pity of course, as we know now. Thank you anyway. No problem. Hello. Hey Carl again. I just wanted to see what you think about this. So we know that one of the foundations of the universe is that division of labour, so masculine, feminine and male and female emerged out of that. Now each race has a group evolutionary strategy based on that, whether they're cognitively feminine, bias or cognitively masculine. And we can see literally throughout history, it's European, cogmasculine, technology masters versus the Jews, masters of storytelling and lies and beta males, cogfemmes. Like what do you think about... So for that reason, their first institution was, religion and ours was the military. And for that reason, I think if you can extrapolate from what I just said, because I don't want to like rant on and say too much, Europeans are sentient evolution and innovation and Jews are sentient entropy and destruction. So in a way we might need them to keep us sharp and keep evolving otherwise. So we can defeat time one day. Like Jews are like the embodiment of that. What do you think about that? That's a bit deep. So this is a kind of theory, I can't remember his name now, Otto Weiniger. He's a Jewish writer in the 10th of the turn of the century of Vienna. He writes a book, Sex and Character. It's promoted by Dietrich Eckart in his 1921 Judaism from... Bolshevism from Moses to Lenin. And he explains this and he thinks about it. And so it's a theory, but you need to understand that a lot of it... It's very hypothetical, but we have to remember that if we're looking at this in sociological terms, it's not just Jews versus Europeans. It's every group against every group. It's not just one group against one group. It's a massive combat between different groups and logic. And I mean the amount of... I've kind of put up in the past, but a lot of the theories of Jewish inventions and claims Jews and men are standing still, rubber, rubber condoms, you name it. Nineteen, nine percent of them are just not true. They're just not... They're not based upon anything. They're just someone saying, oh, this happened. And then you've got all these other Jews who run with it. So, and then you get things like the Nobel Prize argument, which is based upon counting a lot of people who would never have considered themselves Jewish as Jewish. For example, there's a bunch... I can't remember his name now. Yes, Adolf von Beyer. So he was won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, the first one. And he had a paternal Jewish grandmother who converted to prosentism, but he would have never considered himself Jewish. But yet, all of a sudden, in around the 1920s, 1930s, they begin to claim he is, even though he's dead now and he can't defend himself. And he would have considered one by Israel, but at the same time, you're including him, despite claiming that he wouldn't have been Jewish, but they're throwing him in any way. And it kind of comes back to what they kind of do in an argument. They do what I call like a shell game, where they have three definitions of Jewishness, and they use them interchangeably, and they mix them around to make whatever point they're making, but they don't tell you they're doing it, and they often do it in contraventions to their own logic. So you often get claims of this that just come about, and they're not based on anything, when you actually go and dig. That makes any sense. Yeah, they're full parasite. I mean, look at... Judaism itself, right, is just the inversion of a lot of Platonism and stuff that they learned from the Greeks anyways. The pre-Socratics, so that notion of hell came from... What's his name? I forget his name now. Solon. No, not Solon. I forgot his name anyway, but yeah, the Jews just invert everything. Even their whole religion is stolen from many of our great thinkers, and Zoroastrianism from the Persians and Scythians. If you look back, Asher Logos does a great job with his videos actually. So yeah, I yield and white power, take care Carl. I really liked what you... Because I follow you now, and what you've pinned at the top. Or no, your last post, and I shared it. Can we stop pretending it's just an accidental that the great men of history almost exclusively denounced Jews and often for almost precisely the same things. So, well done. Let's go. Yeah, and I would say if you... I've done a whole article series on this for different people from Roman poets to Greek historians to philosophers like Blaise Pascal to even modern literary figures that you don't know actually opposed to Jews. People like Bram Stoker, who you may or may not know, that Dracula is basically a Jewish character from the novel of George de Morier called Trilby and the character is called Sven Gali. So Dracula, yes, he has the name of Vlad Dracula from Transylvania, but he's in fact a Jewish character. Yeah, so as you've just came up, can you put your hands up and we will call you. If you don't, we will drop you down assuming you do not want to speak. Radio. Hey Carl, how sharp are you on like military strategy? Is that your wheelhouse or no? Kind of. I mean, I would only kind of... I wouldn't throw this at anybody, but I'll throw it at you. I mean, is there anything that the right could have done to win the war? I mean, aside from the obvious military failures, like, you know, probably should have might be controversial saying this to a Brit, but Dunkirk was probably an L. They probably should have, you know, probably should have used some chemical weapons. Probably shouldn't have been so nice to certain people. But there was definitely some military L's that contributed to the right's loss. I mean, what's your take on that on the whole? Okay, first of all, I think the book you and your listeners need to read is John Mosey's book Death Ride. It completely rewrites the history of World War Two. So what it does is it focuses away from the concept of, you know, the great narratives of, you know, oh, Stalin grabbed this massive defeat, Kersk was a massive defeat and what not. What he says is, well, actually, let's look at the statistics. Let's look at what we actually know that knows true because we know German military statistics are pretty accurate because we look at the hard numbers and the quantifiable stuff instead of the narrative. Yeah. And what you what and what and what then to what then kicks out is that we then suddenly see that the Germans are probably winning World War Two up to around mid 1944. They weren't losing. They were winning. So even with even the not even the claim that Stalin grab with the mass, try to get was a big defeat. Yes. But the Germans were still very much in the top in the driving seat till mid 1944, really, with the and you're right, there was there was a bunch of mistakes. But again, let's put this in context of. So Dunkirk really wasn't Hitler. That was Field Marshal von Wünschted and his decision because he was concerned that the battle of after the battle of that where the French had had limited success and then they'd almost cut off the German panzers because the French tanks were all heavier than the German tanks at this point. You have to remember that really the heaviest tank the Germans had was the panzer fall, but it was the short barrel variant. It was only meant for infantry support. And so the Germans had very little to do against these tanks other than by using 88. So that's the kind of context to it. But also you have to remember that Hitler thought he was dealing with rational political people in the Brits because Churchill was very much not. He was dying. He was trying to pick a fight. He'd been trying to pick a fight since the mid 1930s when he was basically bought out by a Jewish cabal. He was rescued. I think it's a lot of work to really document that. And yes, so he so then we have things like the Germans, the German performance in Russia was generally very, very good. They did perform very well. They did take heavy losses. But again, I would say the biggest mistake Hitler made in World War Two was declaring war in America in late 1941. He didn't have to. But I understand why he did, given that the Franklin's line of Roosevelt had effectively declared an undeclared war on Germany by by by using the US Navy to attack German. Was it also Pearl Harbor because the Axis declared war on Japan air go declare war on Germany or is that not how that? No, it was so. So so so the Japanese declare war on the US because the US has been corralling them into a into a situation in Asia by the oil embargo. Yeah, the oil embargo. So they get into the situation. The Japanese the Japanese figure, OK, we're going to go for it. So the Japanese are facing the choice of either the attack the Soviet Union, or the attack the US, the attack the US to try and rebuild their own their own supplies in the middle. Really quickly, we did have Intel prior to the Pearl Harbor attack that the Japs were going to attack. Correct. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. There's that because the German the Americans and they've broken the purple code, which is Japan's main military code by that point anyway. So they kind of knew they kind of had some idea. And that was correct me for wrong. That was rolled up by Naval Intelligence to FDR and he stood down. Correct. Yeah, basically, as I understand it. Yeah. So so you so you'd say back to your original to the original question. So you'd say the turning point of when the war was was unwinnable for the Reich was when it was unwinnable by early 945. It was that late. Is that like the reason why it's because so we know it's winnable up to mid 944 because what happens is the Germans get hit by two offenses at the same time. People often people often see operation overlord in Normandy as this kind of standalone thing. But the reality is it's combined with Operation Bacchion, which is the Soviet matter of winter summer offensive against the Germans in 1944. Now the Germans could take one of these. They couldn't take both because essentially they had a situation where they were funneling troops. Maybe I think it's 20. I think it was 20% of troops in were in the West. 75% were in the East and 5% were in Italy. So essentially the Germans are stretched always. How much of a drag was Italy? Sorry, I got to go here because how much of a fucking drag was Italy lesson usually assumed. Okay, the reality is the Italians did perform very well when they were properly led and they had there was an SS division, which was a purely Italian, which did some did some did some really good service and there were loads of Italians who did that. And we also know from German memoirs like Hans von Lux, Panzer Commander, that the Italians in North Africa weren't bad. The problem the Italians have was A, they had crab equipment and B, they were in luck about term lines led by donkeys. Their generalship was horrible. They performed very very bad. You actually never hear about Italian generals, do you? No. I can't fucking name one. I think there's a reason for that. Yeah, they didn't perform very well at all when they were put up there in the Nazi. You have to remember the Italians got fundamentally beaten by the, they almost got beaten by the Ethiopians. Which is pretty embarrassing and that's why I think, you know, I'm German myself and I always maybe attribute more blame to the Italian underperformance and I should in North Africa and elsewhere. But I guess you're right. It was poor as poor leadership, which is why there's no notable Italian generals from the war to have note and that's that that checks out. So was there how much how much did the time of year of some of the big Russian offensives play a role in terms of like the winner and whatnot? Would that play a big role? You mean in the loss? Yeah, in the loss. And so there's two questions. There's one that's the is the classic mud argument, right? Yeah, we're just, you know, frankly, trying to, you know, take Moscow on the winner. Correct. Okay. So yeah. So okay. So first of all, operation, I think it's operation cyclone. I think it was the one that was operation typhoon. I put a cyclone on the two that with winter, winter Moscow is that the truth is, is that the Germans. Yes, the Germans got there slightly late, but the reason there was a reason the Germans got there slightly late. The reason is, is because of the first battle of Kiev. Now this is often that this is this was cited post war heavily by German generals claiming that Hitler had lost in the war. The truth is that this is one of the best military moves that was made in World War Two, because and it was one of Hitler. It was wasn't hit the pure brain child. But it's one of them. And he, he and I think I come to which a general it was came up with it. And they basically rather than choose to attack Moscow, as a lot of okay, W. General W. General's wanted to do. They said, okay, let's divert bits of army group center to, to encircle the Soviet armies in the rank here, which netted the Germans. What is 700,000 prisoners? And you have to remember that despite all the myths, the Red Army, this was this was by the bulk of the Red Army. Basically, they just they just captured a good part of the Red Army. And the Stalin can replace them. And the only reason the only reason Moscow failed, it wasn't because it was partly winter. But it was because of the swords telegram. So Richard sword in the Japanese in the German Embassy in Japan. Found out that the Japanese weren't planning to make to launch an offensive against the against the against the Soviet Union. So he relayed that to Stalin. And Stalin then could release the Far East and army, which was the only army he had left that was in any way intact. This was then deployed against the Germans, in the winter offenses. Was that Zeus? Sorry, Carl. Okay, I'm sorry. No, if you want to finish that thought. No, it's fine. So that was then deployed. And then again, it comes into criticism, because people say, oh, yes, Hitler, Hitler gave a stand and stand and fight order. To the German armies. The truth is, is that because of the scale of that offensive and the fact that Germans were heavily, heavily overstretched, had Hitler not done that, then there would have been much more of a route on the front from the group center, because they weren't they weren't prepared for a defensive war at that point at all. So again, it's, it's one of these ones where he's got a lot of blame when reality is he has intervention often helped not hinder. Well, it was very convenient to blame Hitler post war. I mean, what else would you do if you're a general post war? It's all Hitler's fault. All military failures. All all my strategic failures and bad calls are Hitler's fault. So it goes, it goes that way. What was that book? What was that book, Reco? Carl. So, okay. So it's part of so that it's a book by John Mosier called Death Ride is part of the three part of three book series. One is called the myth of the Great War. The second is called the cross of iron. The third is called death ride. And basically what Mosier does is rewrite the history of World War One, the mid the the the chain that lead up to World War Two and then World War Two using statistics rather than narratives because he argues and I would argue he's correct. That when we look at the statistics, they tell a very different picture from what from the because we can actually validate that saying, you know, that the that so such and such would have happened is not an argument. Never, never, never would be good stuff. Appreciate the recommendation. I'll follow up on that. That's all I got for Carl. Somebody else wants to take a swing at him. Hey guys, I think I was next. I don't hear Zeus. Are you guys okay if I go ahead? Yeah, man. Shoot your shot. Absolutely. All right. Well, Zeus, if you are listening, thanks so much for getting me back up. I had to drop because I'm at work and a bunch of people who probably wouldn't like my question were around. So I just firstly want to say thank you, Carl, for taking the time to come in. I was in discussion with radio Wymer two nights ago. I was the one who brought the supposed to be the first to come in. Supposed quote of Rabbi Rabinovic to everybody's attention. I had found stumbled upon the CIA release and, you know, found it quite incendiary and another person had come in and said, well, this has been debunked by this historian named Carl. And I'm thinking to myself, well, who is this guy and what does he know? And here I am an hour and a half later and oh my God, you seem to know everything. A bit of a glaze there. of a glaze there. But what I was wondering was you said, and I missed a bit of it, you had said that it was released written by Eustace Mullins, which I had found to be one of the explanations of it. I was wondering if you know anything about the reception of the article number one, because I believe you said it was a newspaper released in a newspaper. So I'm wondering if you could speak to, you know, kind of the reception of this letter in American society post-World War II. And then secondly, if I could, I don't want to take too much of your time, you had mentioned Rudyard Kipling and the White Man's Burden. This was mentioned yesterday by another speaker and something I had heard of and wasn't too familiar with, but I did some research last night and found that the White Man's Burden was basically like an anthem of American expansionism, imperialism, during the Spanish-American War. And I guess Kipling had written it and passed it off to, I think it was Roosevelt. And he was basically saying, you guys need to annex the Philippines and go over there. And, you know, basically it is the White Man's duty to civilize the darker places in the world. I know now that post-colonial courses at the university level, you know, they base a lot of them like to open with this is what I'm told as an example of how racist, you know, our culture was in going to these colonies, not colonies, but other places and colonizing. And I'm wondering, have you ever thought of writing maybe like a newer version of the White Man's Burden? I guess what I'm asking is, you know, what would you imagine today as the White Man's Burden, as the burden of people who come to a space like 1488 and feel like we are now being invaded by these, you know, people from other parts of the world. So, yeah, first about, so use the small ones if you could. And then, you know, what would you imagine the White Man's Burden is today? Thank you. Sorry, sorry, it's so long winded. That's all right. Okay, so, Conn in McGinley, first of all, the newspaper was Conn in McGinley's Common Sense, I believe it's 1952. This was released in, I might be wrong in that, it might be 1956 or something like that. But essentially, it as to as to being reception, it wasn't really, it wasn't really well received. It was just another, it was another right-wing newspaper at the time. And it was pro, it was, it was basically your dealing with the end of this period in the 1950s, where American nationalism is becoming subverted by this new kind of nationalist, this new kind of patriotism, which was more universalist. And if you've ever picked, if you've ever heard of the John Birch Society and National Review, they both come from this time. And the great person to read on this is Rev. Oliver, who is a Professor of Classics, and very much on our side, who was, was part of the foundation of both, and then explained a lot about where they come from, what went wrong with them, and what they were trying to achieve. So essentially, you have this time where all this information, it will, where one style of nationalism is changing to this kind of universalist patriotism that we then see in the 60s, 70s, which then becomes the standard from the 80s, the 80s, and 90s that will waste the neocons of the early 2000s. So essentially, we have that there is these, there's these various, right-wing bestsellers that occur at the time. I don't remember the name, it's John, it's Colonel John Beattie, I think it was the, the Iron Curt and over America, in which was very much again on our side. He was one of, he'd often, often people often say that Arthur Questler is the 13th tribe, is the origin of the popularity of the Kazar hypothesis. The truth is actually Beattie, it's, because that's where, that's where the original argument comes from, where that's who the people who picked it up in the Anglophone world first came from. It came from Beattie because he, I think he published in 1953 or 1952 or something, and his book went through like 19 editions within two or three years, which gives you some idea of the scale of how popular it was. So yeah, that's where, so Mullins is trying to compete with that and he's trying to come up with, you know, new insights, new ideas. And one of the things that I was, the only argument I think for the truth of that quote is the name of the Jewish author, Rabbi, Rabbi something Rabinovich. Basically, it's a Jewish joke. It's Rabbi of Rabbi, it's Rabbi of Rabbi of Rabbi, which was the only thing I could think of is the reason I would say it would be the only argument for it being real. Okay, what was your other, what was your other thing, sorry? Yeah, very, very quickly. I missed the title of the Beattie book that had so many It's the Iron Curtain over America, I think. Okay, okay, excellent. I'm going to look that one up. And then yeah, the second one had to do, my second question had to do with the whole idea of Kiplings, the white man's. Oh, right. Okay, yeah, I'm with you now. So Kiplings, so the, the burden, the white man's burned today, yes, you're right. That was the original Kiplings idea of, you know, that the white man civilizes the world, the white man brings, you know, civilization to foreign dark parts. Whereas today, it's very much a case of it's not that it's about understanding who we are and to use it to use another Kipling essence. It's the, it's the poem of the idea of the awakened Saxon, it's when the Saxon begins to hate. That's what's the white man, but the white man's burned today isn't to go off to India and civilize India. It's not to go to the Philippines and conquer the Philippines. It's to conquer himself and the Jewish, and the Jewish programming that gets pushed so heavily upon us. So that we actually, we become proud of our history and we come proud, we come proud of the fact that fundamentally, European civilization is a, is a, is the warrior civilization par excellence. We forget that our history is full of wars, yes, but it's extraordinarily successful to the point where there is no other civilization that can even touch it. I mean, when you think about things like, like Africa, like when the British went into the British, the French, the Portuguese, the Belgians, or went into Africa, the Africans, which is completely slaughtered. And the only time the Africans win a battle, which is Islam, if it's really Islam, Diwana against the British is because, it's because, A, the British run out of ammunition and the British guns over, the British guns overheated. It's that simple. So our thing today is to forget the, you know, the delight of universalism and to conquer the fact that fundamentally be proud of who we are, be proud of our history, but probably be proud of our religions, be proud of who, of everything that we are. And to not listen to all these people telling us we have contributed nothing or we owe them something. The reality is, is they owe us and India alone owns us billions. The Raj, despite all the rumors, never made any money. They were given all this infrastructure that they still use. They're given all these buildings they still use. They were given a functioning government. The content of India was created by the British. Are there any pro-Western imperialism books today, Carl? Like kind of modern, that make a good argument for everything you're saying? Or is there any works to that effect today? I mean, I think there's a book by Pascal Brookner of the August thing, but I can't remember his name now. He's the Canadian sociologist, the uniqueness of Western civilization. I can't remember his name. But he makes a very, very good case in that book, as does Kevin McDonald's in his book, I can't remember either, about Western civilization and basically the fact we need to, as a people, grow up and be pro what we've done. Because fundamentally, we owe them nothing. This is huge. I mean, they just had some bullshit, fucking aboriginal holiday. There's a national holiday. There's national holidays in Canada devoted to this. So maybe Eger can chase down these titles and share them because this is a huge narrative that needs to be rewritten. Western imperialism is fucking based and good. And it did the world a tremendous service. So the fact that we're taught that it was mean and evil and bad is a fucking travesty in my mind. Yeah, if I can say really quickly, radio and Carl, thank you so much. I will, I'm going to look up the uniqueness of Western civilization. I wish Ferry was here right now. Yeah, we did just have a holiday yesterday where we're all meant to basically atone for the sins of our past. And there's a lot of people who are just not buying it. But yeah, there was plenty to talk about yesterday, so I won't bring more of that up. But thank you so much. I can drop down now. This has been extremely informative. Thank you all. Yeah, truth and reconciliation, brother. The truth is, is we've given them all of it. And the reconciliation is that they owe us reparations now. In your estimation, Carl, what's the motivation? Is this just to beat Whitey down? Is it the obvious shit? Do you have a deeper take on why we're forced to go through these fucking humiliation rituals for these lesser races? Well, if you think about it, the entire narrative is based upon really, I mean, without some try, it is the cultural Marxism logic. But it's what you have to remember our cultural Marxism and is that while yes, it deconstructs Western civilization, it provides tools, the people who are promoting it. Yes, they're often Jewish, but they're non-white. What about them? Well, hang on a minute. Well, if you think about it, like the Kim Il-sung, I can't pronounce his name now, the leader of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh, that's it. And all these people, even Mao, what did they start out as? They didn't start out as Marxists. They started out as nationalists, as non-white nationalists. So what they're doing is they're promoting their views and they're weaponizing this idea of hypercriticism to attack Western civilization. And that metric is often called Euro-communism is its origin. And Euro-communism, to differentiate it from both Maoism and standard Marxism, is it's all about what the revolutionary class is. And the revolutionary class in Euro-communism, so to give you some idea, in standard Leninism, it is the bourgeois, it is the urban proletariat. So the urban, not the bourgeois, the urban proletariat with, what's it called? With Maoism, it's the peasantry. But with Euro-communism, that switches, and Euro-communism comes very fashionable in the 1970s in the West. And it switches to two groups, students and also- Is Euro-communism sort of classic Russia Bolshevism? Is that- No, it's not. It's a different beast entirely. It's basically, it's taking the idea of Marxism and the proletariat and the revolutionary class and saying that the actual revolutionary classes are not, it's not the urban workers, it's not the farmers, which are aka the peasants of Mao, but instead it is students and ethnic and sexual minorities, which are then weaponized against the majority, which is what we now have. We have this weird alliance between capitalism, between corporate capitalism and crony capitalism, and these people who believe in this ideology of Euroma, of what's the term Euro-communism, aka the Frankfurt School and everything to do with it. And we have this situation where they are weaponizing the hell out of it. Now, a good example of this I give you is even in Islam, even the Islamists, if there was some, there were some documentaries about people raiding Taliban strongholds in the mid, I think 2010s or something, and they actually raided them and they, they, they, they had to do them afterwards. They said, what, what, what, what were you trying to do? And the way they said it was, we, we, we came, we came here to kill pale faces. They didn't say non-Muslims, they said pale faces. And that's essentially what you're dealing with. It's ideologies of, nationalist ideologies pretending to be something else. So, like the pan-Islamism really comes from, is substitute for Arab nationalism, which, which failed to kill Israel. So that's became, that became popular. And we have modern conventions of this right now, Carl. We have the FBA, which is the foundational black Americans, which are effectively black nationalists. You have the black Hebrew Israelites. We have literally nationalists, which are, so yeah, this, this tracks, this is exactly the type of deep take that I was hoping for. So thanks for, thanks for getting into this. And if you want to finish your thought, please. No, it's not a problem. But the, what I would say is you have to remember that a lot of the history, they tell you the Afrocentric history comes from Jews, specifically too. It comes from Martin Bernal, who again is Jewish, and Mesut Melville Herskovitz, both of whom pretty much are the founding fathers of Afrocentrism. So if you ever heard of the book Black Athena, that was written by Martin Bernal. And that's what all the black shoes, basically, without, often without actually having read the thing, because it's got three volumes. Well, what was that European communism term that you used? Euro communism. Is that also fundamentally as Jewish as I expected? I mean, is any of this not fundamentally Jewish? No, fundamentally, when you really get into it, your communism's ideologues are so associated with people at the New Left Review. And if you look at the board of them, and when it all started, when it all began, again, that's Jews. And you get into all these different people. To people associated with the 1960s, riots, riots in France, that were student riots, again, when the leaders were often Jewish, you get into the different players involved. So the classic thing of, I kind of like sometimes to bring out, is that people don't realize there was a bunch of Jews involved in the Infidel Castro's Communist Revolution in Cuba. And that fundamentally, Castro himself was arguably Jewish, as was Raoul, his brother. By the way, quickly, I just came up here to say, Carl, the uniqueness of Western civilization was written by Ricardo Duchain. That's the one. Yeah, I talked with him, I talked with him on here sometimes. I just read his name. Hey, Carl, if you don't mind real quick, what was the author of the book, Death, Right? Oh, Death, Right. That is, I can't be saying that. One second. That is John Mosier. Do you have a reading list, Carl? Do you have like a, is any of this lives anywhere? Like you're like reading lists of your recommended books, started to interrupt? No, it's fine. No, I put ones out there on X before. I haven't done anything formal, but I need to because a lot of the stuff is, a lot of the stuff is, the only reason I haven't done it is because it's just, it's so specific. So people will ask me, what do I need to read about Holocaust? What do I need to read? What do I need to read about World War II? What do I need to read about the military conflict of World War II? What do I need to read about World War I? What about, you know, I'll be honest with you, Carl, not to tell you how to do anything, because obviously, this is your will, but it might even make sense to like a sub stack post with like a sub divided up because I get guys asking me for book records and I don't always even have, I don't have nearly the depth and breadth that you do. So it's one of those things where if you were to put like a master list with like categories, again, recommendation, do with it as you wish. I need the spelling on that author, by the way, the last name. John Mosier. So M O S I E R. I E R. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. Um, Jack, Jack Zoo is next. Oh, even guys, no special takes to make on this on this space. Probably the most informative space I've ever listened to. And I just want to thank everyone involved and Carl in particular. Awesome. Awesome knowledge. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Jack. Next is Fash Bird 28 14. Hi, Carl. I have another question about Rommel. He seemed to end on a bad note. I know he was buried with honors, which makes me wonder, did Hitler know he really wasn't part of the plan? And if he didn't know he wasn't part of the plan, why would he still have to kill, kill himself? Okay. So Rommel, Rommel was a devotional socialist to put him in his life. However, Rommel was on Rommel because Rommel's status is a major military general in World War II. And I, and I felt martial of that. He was associated on the, on the fringes of the Kreisau Circle, which was a major part in the July bomb plot. Now, I would agree that I think it was a mistake because he was basically requested, he was told, you know, basically because of his status that he was asked to commit suicide. Yes, I think this was wrong. But I can understand it given the scale of what this plot was and also how close it came to actually succeeding. It was one of several, but you have to remember that basically the, the Kreisau Circle had basically built up a entire conspiracy and entire counter-government. They were going to go and implement to, as they saw it end the war, but reality was it wouldn't have done it. So I think it just is an unfortunate thing, but it happens in wartime that people make bad decisions based upon limited information and also in the wake of a pretty serious assassination attempt. Does that make sense? Yes, thank you. It's like sober whites as it's called. Yeah, sober. Oh, shit. I was gonna, I was gonna ask a quick question. And first I want to premise it with sorry if it's kind of like a transfer in one of the old family books onto a PDF document. Can you hear me Tomcat? I think we got multiple people speaking. Tom, could you hear it? I think Reich had a question and then sober whites. What do you got, Reich? If you want to get that in, I think Tom. It's not like a super duper fancy question, but I know that there is a lot of skepticism when it comes to occultism and the third Reich. And I wanted to know your perspective on the matter. Is it a bunch of baloney or is there some truth behind that? It's a bunch of baloney. The reason we know this and a great book to pick up is Nicholas Goodrick Clark's third edition of the occult origins of Nazism, where he goes through this and debunks. He debunks a lot of the junk. A lot of it really is post-war. It's really, it's like the Hitler, Hitler was Jewish or Hitler was a homosexual myth. Really, it gets picked up in the 1950s and 60s by the psychoanalytic movement, so the Jews who believe in David Freud. They pick it up. They run with it and they kind of fall away in popularity, but then the Christian right picks it up in the 80s and 90s and the 70s as well. And they run with it and we get these kind of weird, smishmash of stuff. The truth is that there's very little involvement, there's very little impact between the two. Certainly, calling Hitler and occultism would just be wrong. But in fact, the first mention of it occurs in the only in the late 1930s. It occurs with the British writer, this kind of swagely Christian called Louis Spence, who also wrote about Lantis. And he begins to kind of push this particular narrative. It doesn't really take on during the war. There is an element of occult propaganda during the war. And if you can find it, there was a really odd book called Nostradamus and the Nazis by Alec Howe from the 1960s. That has a lot of odd information about it, about history of some of this stuff that gets picked up. But the other book you want is Moine Hanon Flowers is The Secret King, which deals with another aspect of this claim, which is Carl-Maria Willigut, who is Himmler's occult advisor. He was the who's the who's a main figure in all this and also kind of talks about and debunks a lot of the myths and a lot of the claims that don't make a lot of sense when you're actually digging into it. And that's kind of where it stands. I would just say that I think when someone says, you know, oh, Hitler was an occult, a good example of how this works is you've probably may or may not have heard of a man called Lanz von Liebenfels, who was promoting a broad, it's often called an occult magazine called Ostala in the eternal century Vienna. He had been a Catholic monk. He was the end of his life, a well regarded Catholic theologian, strangely. And he published this book and he argued for and it's often said he argues this being a pagan occult stuff that Hitler and because Liebenfels claimed in post-war that Hitler visited him sometime in the 1910s that to get some additional copies of like back numbers he missed of Ostala, that this is therefore he was a big, who's big inspiration for Hitler's views. The truth is, is that this is purely fancy on Liebenfels' part. But also when you bother to read Liebenfels and only one of his books has been translated into English, which is theozoology, it is on archive and you can read it if you like. It's if you are Christian, it's probably quite an interesting book to read because it's a different kind of theory, different kind of thinking. But A is not occult, it's just him talking in very, very spiritual terms half the time and also having all the alternate theories about the origin of the universe. And B, the only person who ever said this was Liebenfels himself and the Germans actually when they took over Austria in 1938, immediately the Kostapo visited Liebenfels because he'd been claiming during the 1930s that Hitler was one of his disciples. They visited him and told him to shut up and shut him down. So again, all this stuff, it's very, it's big claims often made upon a Jewish foundation because one of the foundational texts is a book called The Morning of the Magicians, which is written by two French authors, one of whom was Jewish and also a common one was Trevor Ravenscroft, The Spirit of Estony, which again, if you actually read the forward to it, he actually says, oh, by the way, I actually divined a lot of the information in this book from crystals, basically, by astral astral astral projection or something. It was it's quite a bizarre. When you get into this kind of stuff, it's kind of bizarre. And a lot of it is just very very self serving testimony post war, because of course at that point, no one's going to be around to contradict them. But the fact is is, the Germans cracked down pretty heavily on this stuff. But by the late 1930s, at the very least, does that make any sense? Yeah, totally. I was an affirmed believer that the Riker, even Hitler himself, participated in any of that. I just wanted to, you know, clear up some of the misconceptions. And you said it beautifully, brother. Thank you. Looks like extra has his hand up. That's the only one I see. Oh, actually, sober whites first. Thank you. Just get the glaze out of the way first. My education span, three countries, hundreds of professors, well, excuse me, about over 100 teachers overall. And if I had had anybody with your grasp of your craft, I would have been, you know, a better person for it. So just want to say, you know, very impressed and congratulations on on having that. Well, how do you address the urban legend, let's say that methamphetamines were created? Is there any truth to it? Methamphetamines were created by, you know, Hitler's chemist, and he was on drugs during maybe the latter half of his career. Okay. So this is this is again, a common misconception. So this is true. So there's there's elements of truth in this in that the Germans did use math. Yes, they did. They use math to keep people awake. But this is not uncommon at the time. The Americans did the same thing. People were doing things like this in World War One. It's often forgotten that the only drugs that drugs as such were only made illegal in Britain and the United States after World War One. So for example, if you if you're a British officer, and you were in the trenches and in France, your wife or your mother could go down to Fortnum and Masons and they could order a care package, which would include everything from cocaine to heroin to opium and to whatever you wanted. People would inject themselves with this stuff and they were they were going over the top. So again, it's it's a contextual thing that's kind of really lacking. But also the entire concept of Hitler, Hitler, Hitler being on drugs is again a misnomer. Because one of the things we know about him is he had a he had a pretty serious problem from the mid 1930s onwards and in regard to his gastrointestinal system. He'd had treatments for it for many years and no one could ever get to the bottom of it. Basically, it's he's often said he was very gassy. So he had very bad wind apparently, according to some people. And he had so he wants to deal with some of these problems. He went to doctors and he had two different doctors. They prescribed him a series of medications, which included some some it was some of them were things like perverting or whatever it was, that they were on a cocktail of things that he was given to kind of help him deal with these problems. So it's kind of it's disingenuous to argue that Hitler was was kind of on was high on was high all the time because he wasn't he was being given drugs by doctors in the same way that many people in the US today are given, you know, they they told, okay, well, you know, take a take a pill, take a pill for your heart. And then there is a consequence of that, okay, then we'll give you something else. They give him maybe two of the medications. Hitler was on a couple. Again, there is the there is the myth that he was he was on this massive cocktail of stuff, but we actually know what he was on. A lot of this claim is really, really made to a vilify Hitler be the beat to sell books and sell documentaries. It isn't actually that genuine. A great book to read on this sort of stuff is Irving's biography of water morel Hitler's doctor, which kind of goes into this in some in some level of detail. And also fundamentally, that we have to understand that Hitler had what we believe he Parkinson's disease, triggered by very high stress. So as time went on, he got more he got he was having a harder and harder time with things, because he had Parkinson's disease, and it wasn't diagnosed at that point, they didn't know what it was. So the Germans are trying to treat this thing, they don't know what it is. And unfortunately, Hitler has it at that point, the executive time. And he's having to have these you're trying to try to make few decisions. And he's not thinking straight, unfortunately, half the time, because of the fact he has Parkinson's. And, you know, occasionally, this gets brought up in the context of syphilis, because people say the other argument is, well, Hitler attacked syphilis a lot in main camp. So therefore, what we're looking at here in post in the late 30 in the late 30s, the middle late 40s, is we're looking at Hitler having a attack of tertiary syphilis. The truth is, is that there's no there's no information, there's no truth about that at all. As far as I can work out, it's just it is just Parkinson's. And he's responding to Parkinson's, and they don't know what they're dealing with. And unfortunately, it's, you know, wrong place from time. Great explanation. Thank you. And I'll follow with one thing. Yeah, maybe his vegan diet has something to do with gastrointestinal problems. Okay, so Hitler was never a vegan. But he was vegetarian. But he was a vegetarian and doctor's orders for that very same reason from 1938 was he was he was a pescatarian. So he was eating fish as well. And then in 942 and 1943, they put him on a full vegetarian diet because he because he wasn't he wasn't having getting relief anymore. So they switched into that. So again, that's one of the myths about Hitler that he was a vegetarian. In fact, he was a meat eater up until the mid to late 1930s. So, really quick, just want to chime in here. It wasn't like like meth, like when we talk about meth, we're talking about like shards, we're talking about rocked up shit. It was a different compound. It was a it was a different chemical composition than what we have today. So I just don't want to like get anyone thinking that like he was smoking like a meth pipe. Like, no, no. Yeah, pharmaceutical. It's like it's like it's like a medicaid. It's like a medicaid. It's like taking the best we can like give you. It's like taking an opioid. So you're taking something. Yes, you're taking opium. You're taking, you know, a drug, but it's a medicaid dose. Like Yeah, yeah. Same same again. Extra. Thank you again, Zeus. And that was very interesting question and answer there about the drugs and the context around it. And, you know, I just know that a lot of people like to point at Hitler, who is appearing in 15 frames per second to be not just evil, according to the people who want to point out what happened, what they think happened there at the 1933 Olympics, but also they want to say he was a drugged up, crazy evil despot. So I think the context is excellent. My question for Carl is one which I'm really asking for a speculation. And it is something which I have thought about at great length when I like several whites have thought about my own education and my own teachers, particularly history. I dropped history in middle school because I thought well, nothing that happened in the past could have any effect on me now because all those bad men are dead. And I thought the only problems facing humanity were just ones of, you know, finding out the last few things about the hard sciences and engineering and generating enough energy and power for the world. But what I did, I was obviously so disastrously wrong. My, in thinking back then, I'll just say this then, as a bit more of a foreground, when I was actually coincidentally enough, probably six years old, maybe five, I had heard about Hitler and how he didn't like the Jews. And I asked my parents, why is it that Hitler just suddenly didn't like the Jews for no reason at all? And they said, the answer is nobody knows and that's it. And they had told me that we should never lie to each other and never will lie. And I should never lie. And they set me back greatly in my learning because I assumed it was just an unsolved mystery. They would have solved it. It could be solved. So fast forward a few decades then. And, you know, I feel like I've been greatly let down by all the adults and all the teachers. And my contention is my thinking on it, going down these roads of introspection, is that it is not possible for anyone to reach adulthood or let alone be a teacher of anyone of any subject, but certainly not of history, to not have reached very obvious conclusions about who really was the bad guy and who wasn't actually as evil as he was painted. So my question to Carl, as somebody who is obviously very learned in history, even if you think of somebody who's just a lowly high school junior high school history teacher, do you really think that all these people don't don't really in their heart of hearts know what the truth is? Thank you. I think that we have to look at this in a very simple way. It's the Pareto principle. So we have to remember that a lot of people that society wouldn't function if 90% of people were critical thinkers. It wouldn't work. People don't care. What people care about is kind of what the Marxist philosopher Louis Elton said kind of really pointed out really well. I've come back to a lot in my life when he was asked by an Italian communist in 1970s about why don't people want to support communism? He basically said the problem is that until you have a material, until someone's material situation is massively affected and they can't, they see no hope for the future that everything is going wrong in their lives, they're not going to support you because as far as they're concerned, as long as they've got food on the table and they're having having sex, they're having, they've got kids, they're kids having a better future, whatever. They don't care. They don't care that much. They might want to see what they care sometimes or they want to have a moment about it, but that's fundamentally what all of it is. And it's just based on the simple situation. And to me, it's just, you're always going to have this flakper term vanguard of people who believe differently and they're the ones arguing with each other about where things are going to go and what the future is going to be. And it comes back to, I think I had a long time around the concept of propaganda. So a lot of people can think propaganda is a dirty word, even though it comes from the Latin to propaganda feeds to propogate the faith. And all it means really is that it's about getting to the front line of, I've conceived of propaganda as being basically, it's big blob of people in the middle. And you've got all these people on the outside all jockeying for position to get closer to that group, to tell them how to understand the world, what to look at the world. And then everyone's competing for that and that position. And I think that's what's really going on in a lot of what's a lot of what we see in today and what's going on in life. But to come back to your point around Hitler and all the drugs and whatnot, and it's often not forgotten that people like that, the various different major US politicians were often on drugs. JFK famously probably took LSD in marijuana. We've got Richard Nixon basically spent the whole of his presidency drunk or on the drug phenytoin, which was an anti-seizia drug. And so Gerald Ford was also rather drunk, spent a lot of time drinking. But again, this kind of this kind of comes back to this whole understanding of people saying, you know, people having one sound of Hitler, one sound for everyone else, because, you know, a good part of history in the great grades and the greatest books in literature have been composed, sozzled, or completely drunk. And that's just the truth of the matter as far as I work and work out. Does that make sense? I think they dropped. Who's next? It is Sebastian. Hey, so question for Carl. I've been slowly jaypilling my brother. And for the first time yesterday, I heard him say the words, Oh my God, was the Holocaust actually faked? So he's on the verge of, I think, finally believing that. But I'm just wondering what would be the most undeniable proof that you could point me towards that I could give to him to get him over that cliff, basically. Okay. So the best single book to kind of really do the most thorough kind of a kind of a baby's guide to is Nicholas Colestrom's 2014 breaking the spell, which is what it's designed to be. It's very clear that he explains a lot of different things, like for example, enigma, that the enigma interception, nothing about it. He talks about the impossibilities of everything that go on and all the claims. But if I was going to make a rhetorical argument, I would just say, well, it comes down to this, that let's say a third of the Holocaust is Operation Reinhardt from 1942 to 1943. That claim is very simply that one to two million Jews were gassed by the Germans. You also don't gas, they were killed by the Germans using two diesel engines, which which possibly either came from a Soviet submarine or a Soviet tank, and an electric floor in roughly one and a half, two years. Then the Germans, the Germans put them all in the ground, put the cops in the ground, and then they dug them all up again, burned them, and we can't find any trace of them. And it's very simply that it's the logical impossibility of that being true. And it doesn't make any sense, but this is the inevitable logic behind the Holocaust as a theory. And they don't, this is why, if you look at it, a lot of historians who deal with the Holocaust do not touch the actual Holocaust. They just recite the standard facts as they see them, and that's all they do. They don't, they don't do anything more than that. They focus on like interpretation or saying how evil it is, or, you know, the intentionalist, functionalist debate in history. Or, you know, that's it, that's all they do. And then a lot of the interest now has gone away from the camps. Instead, they focus on the Einsatzgruppen, precisely because the very least, if you shoot someone, it isn't logically impossible that you can kill them. As I said, the best thing to do would be go on to, would be to do, use Colestrom's book. If you want a more academic take, Thomas Dalton's debate in the Holocaust is a good, is a good one as well, to kind of give, give someone a bit of context. There's a lot, a lot material out there, but those two will give you a solid understanding of where the research sits as it stands now, not 20, 30 years ago, because there's a lot of stuff you can about from then. That reminds me, actually, there is a documentary I would recommend people watch if they don't, they don't know this topic very well, which is, if you, if you Google it, one third of the Holocaust, it's a documentary, it's about two hours long, but no, it's not two hours, I think it's more than that. But it's a long documentary, but it's great to watch because it goes through a lot of the logical impossibilities and a lot of the evidence of how it works and what the claims are and what the logic is. And it really does do a good job of explaining why. So what is to so nuts. I want to, yeah, what was the name? Luke, one third of the Holocaust, one third of the Holocaust. And just to answer something else to that guy's question about the Holocaust, for me, what cracked open, you know, my, you know, search on it was when I found out that David Cole, this Jew, I had questions about it. Like, you know, for some reason, a Jew looking in the Holocaust and kind of like on his way of debunking at Auschwitz, that was a big powerful one. And also like, why is it illegal to question the Holocaust was another huge one for me to like go, hmm, what are they hiding there? Now, Carl, I want to ask you a question and kind of like lighten up the mood a little bit, but get back to the serious stuff. But, you know, obviously, you know, if you're to look at, you know, my thirst trap videos of me lifting weights and put up to 25, like I said, my pro professional football player. And you see like, wow, do that guy's Jack. You obviously have this big sexy brain that you're toting around that all the chicks are digging right now. So what do you do to keep that brain looking so buff? Like, do you have a reading regimen? Do you have a photographic memory? What's the key to your sexy brain? I read I've read a lot in my life. I read a book a day, pretty much. If not to wait, wait, wait, hang on, Carl, hang on, Carl, you read an entire book every day. Is that one to two books a day? You read the whole thing cover to cover? Carl? Carl? He's making you wait on that answer. I don't think he's messed around. He doesn't seem like a guy that jokes around much. Yeah, he took a second to read a book for you. Carl, are you reading a book right now, bro? Just funny, three. Carl, are you reading bud? I think he lost Carl to a buddy. I have to bring him back in. Damn, that sounds like something he just says so modestly, right? I just read a book a day. I wonder if he's got some sort of photographic memory though. I don't know how the heck. I mean, he must not to speak for me. He must to agree. That's a good one. He might be reading a book. I just thought no. All right, we'll get him back. Simon. I've been following Carl for a long time. I talk to him all the time on Twitter. I was going to ask him about a couple of authors. Yeah, when he says he reads a book a day, he's really not joking, at least essays and stuff like that. I was on a few days ago and I kind of recommended some reading for people too. A lot of these essays are 40, 70, 80 pages long. You can get through them in an afternoon. I'd really like to encourage. I haven't been following HT for that long or anything, but I like your stay sober and work out and everything. I'd just like to add to that that you got to work your brain out too. There's no reason to be a low IQ Nazi. There is, like I said the last time, there is a firm foundation for your beliefs. It's been going on for a millennium. That is why history is so important. Read Carlisle. I was going to ask him about Carl Schmidt and Ernst Nolte today. I think reading some Ernst Nolte in particular, and it's hard to find. You're going to have to find it online because it was only translated a couple years ago, but Ernst Nolte's European Civil War from 1917 to 1945. Basically what he's kind of, I haven't read through the whole thing, but from what I gather, a lot of times people talk about this interwar period of peace and everything. Basically, his posits that that just wasn't the case. It was a European Civil War from the first world war to the end of the second, where in the middle of it there wasn't as much firing. I wish Carl has always been, since I've met him, such an easy man to talk to. You'll find him very receptive on Twitter as well. I would only add that part of the, whatever you want to call it, the Jewish left-wing democratic conspiracy or anything, they have literally rewritten history since the 1960s. Even American history, for 150 years, this country praised Alexander Hamilton as probably after George Washington, the number one founding father of America. In the 60s, it changed to Jefferson and that's on purpose. Basically, I just had a couple of questions to ask Carl. He's back. We got him back. Before that, we got to circle back to the book of day. Yeah. I want to know that, Regime, because, wait, let me ask you something, being white, what do you read today? How much time do you put in on a book? I think that was Simon Trent. He dropped. Oh, Simon Trent? Oh, my bad. Sorry, I thought it was being white. Yeah, Carl, I read no less than an hour a day. I dedicate an hour to it, usually in the evening. Then on the weekends, I try to do more. I am no Carl Rand, but I'm telling you, exercising your mind, finding good stuff to read, Carl Isle. Carl Isle is excellent, but you kind of got to learn how to read in a magazine or reading a newspaper is not like reading Carl Schmidt. You kind of got to lock in. You got to focus. You got to find that mood. It's a different type of reading. Do it with a pad and paper. When you come across the word, you don't know. Fucking stop. Look it up. Figure out what the guy's talking about. You're basically learning. You're back in school and you're doing it to better your people. Hey, Carl, can you hear us? Yeah, I can hear you. Can we get back to the one two book a day claim? Yeah. What you made, please? And the photographic memory thing, because I don't know how the hell you retain that stuff as well. Did you stop to go finish a book real quick before you came back? No. The way I do it is very very simple. First of all, I've been doing it for a long time. Second, because I'm used to sitting down and just reading a book. But also, it's about what you read. So a lot of people think, oh, yeah, books are 300, 400 pages. They're not all that long. To give you an example, in front of me, I've got the Journal of International History 20th Century Communism, issue for communism and youth. That is around about 220 pages. Speed read, Carl? Are you like, you must be reading at a pretty fast clip? Like, yeah, I do. It's what you read as well. Yeah, it really is what you read. Because some of this stuff, for example, when I read a journal like that, you can you can you can bash that out in about two or three hours, really, because a lot of it is like what you'll find is as if you the more you read, you'll get used to being like, okay, they're ranting about something relatively irrelevant to the moment. Okay, I will skim this. And then you get to the point of, oh, this is this is interesting. So that's a lot of what it is. I mean, a lot of people will tell you, if you try and read philosophy like that, it won't work. Because if you're reading philosophy, it's like you'll you'll do 20, 30 pages, and your brain will hurt. So you can't do that philosophy. But if you do history, if you do specific stuff, if you do that kind of thing, then you can do it. But also what I do is I will listen to audiobooks quite a lot. So I'll often have so when I'm working or doing something, I'll have an audiobook in my ears, rather than music. And it'll be like, for example, I listened to an audiobook about cannibalism the other day, rather bizarrely throughout the day. It was quite interesting. I learned a lot about things I didn't know, and about more recent research about logic, logic, and when that's happened, and that kind of thing. And yeah, that's how you learn. But it's also the fact I do have, I'm not without two of my own, I do have a reasonably high IQ, and I do have a good memory. But I've also been doing this a long time. So a lot of you guys, I don't know how long you've been. I mean, the only example, the person I think is doing this as long as me would be Frank, I assume they're longer, I think. But because I've been doing this so long, and I've been arguing these points for nigh on 20 years, I have a lot of recall of what the points are, what the logic is, what the, you know, what the counter today is. And I learn every day, I don't know everything, by any means. I mean, I learned, I mean, someone today told me that I didn't know that John Paul II was influenced by the work of Helen Blavatsky and her secret doctrine during his time acting in Poland. But someone's something, oh yeah, by the way, this is this is the case, and here's the source. And it's like, oh, okay, I didn't know that. But that's how you pick it up. It's all that kind of stuff. Do you take notes? Yeah, I do. I write notes in books. But then I often translate them into files. So I have these great big word files. Where it's a series of like points, counter points, references and whatever, that then if I'm writing a book, I will literally just take a section of that I'll take a whole section of these notes from different files, throw them in there. Then I know a lot of my books, then I know a lot of the basic references that I need. But also I know the books and I just then I'll go and grab the books I need, have them on my desk. And then I can reference them directly. And make sure I'm telling you. Is there a time when you like flex your vernacular harder and depending on the audience and then dumb it down for other people so it's more digestible? Yeah, yeah, I do. For example, I don't talk in terms of I don't like I'm not a big fan of people who talk in, you know, the big philosophic or big, you know, the big terms, people using things that's slopsistic. And, you know, that was a common thing a few years ago, people suddenly, suddenly, we just cover the term of slopsism. But, you know, like people talking in praxis and that kind of thing, it's like, I don't I don't do that, because I don't like it. I think it's I think it's snooty and ridiculous. And I tend to think most intellectuals need to be thrown in a coal mine and have it blown up. But and that's and that's not because I don't like intelligent conversations, because I think most intellectuals are inherently subversive, actually. But yeah, it's just it's so much, it's so much more, this is just practice. It's practice, knowing what you're doing, and also building upon things, building upon knowledge. So if any of you want to to research something, you'll you'll often see a lot of people give up these long, like, spills, but how to research topics. And one of the ones that I always thought was quite interesting, I can't remember his name, he's a major author on juridism. I'm just going to turn it into juridism. Oh, it's Ronald Hutton. He's a historian, specializing in the 16th century and paganism in general, in Britain. But he had an interesting, he has an interesting conversation about research methods, which he said, basically, he just gets a study gets two or 300 books on the subject. He goes into that he goes into their bibliographies, finds all the books of interest, and then he compiles a list of books he needs to read. And then he assumes it's probably about, you know, a couple of more that he doesn't know about having been mentioned, which we'll go and try and find. And then that's the basis of his books. And it's the same true of things in general, is that if you you have to apply research methods, but not the often the ones I'll teach you, because what they'll teach you is to go off to go off and read, you know, read a standard work, and then run on and then and then just believe it basically and try and validate it and say, well, no, you don't need to do that. You can just you can do it much easier and much quicker by just reading by broad reading and then and then using that specific using that as a way to go into specific reading, and then working out working out what you need to read from that. Awesome. I think we have questions for you. And we're going to jump the line and go and go to Frank here, because Frank has Frank pulls rank over all you peasants. So go ahead, Frank. Yeah, thanks, brother. Hey, Carl, on a serious note, probably the biggest question for me, regarding people like yourself is when are you going to produce a manuscript of your own? You know, a lot of these guys, they do such tremendous research material. And I've known some just brilliant guys that actually buried a couple of guys that were phenomenal. And I was on them for over 20 years, 30 years. When are you going to put down on paper some of the knowledge that you have accrued, you know, because they had a real interesting personal take. Two of these three guys were Irishmen, and they just brought this beautiful symmetry and lyricism in their prose, right? So Carl, I'm just going to put you on notice. You need to get a book out there, brother. In my own name, Frank, I have one monograph and one source reader at the moment. They're on archive. One, the monograph is arguing the case that Jack Ripper was Jewish and especially Jewish at that. And the source reader is on a bunch of, it's basically about, I think it's 60, 70 pages worth of primary sources from people who were in and around the Russian Revolution, testifying about how Jewish it was. As to books, I've still got my protocols of Zion book that is that I need to just do the last bit of pre-reading for, and then I'm going to dump it out and into the real world again. And also my book on Jewish ritual murder is in progress. I've done, I think Simon Trent actually sitting there, but I've actually done Simon Trent. So that will be coming. And I've also finished a good part of my book on the kosher food tax as well. Oh, I love that Carl. Nobody ever talks about that. Nope. I'm the only one that talks about that. Dude, you know, you're not the only one. You're saying that we need to do a big brain guy on that. It increases our food prices. The kosher, it's real. Our food is more expensive. It's not just food. It's the church and it's everything. It's on it. It's literally a fucking scam. Not the kosher scam. Radio. Radio. I have a big answer about it. Hang on one second, Carl. I'm going to bring this up. Sorry for spurging out. That's good. I'm going to bring this up one more time because this actually is funnier than shit, but it's very serious. You guys remember I told you the very first physical altercation that I got in like a studio world was between the Jewish Defense League, Tom Netsker, Wally George. We were all in camera studio and I was one of those fixed people in the audience to quote, deliver a particular question, but I actually had this is a pet peeve six months previous. I had just come across this kosher tax that really flipped me out because just like as an American, probably a very naive American, I'm like going fuck taxes number one. And who are these foreigners that I'm paying money to? So I mean, actually in the scheme of things kosher tax is something that, you know, it probably should push people over the edge because this is literally a foreign dominant move to secure funding from literally the cattle. And thanks for bringing that up, radio. And not only that, I would just add, Carl probably has much greater depth and breadth of understanding of this, but it also, it's a subtle nod to Jews versus Gentiles to give Jews the nod. This food safe Jews, fellow Jews, you eat this. And then I know obviously we all consume kosher food because sometimes it's unavoidable, but it's also a, it's a very direct way to signal food safety to the Jew. And we get poison goyslop. So it's really a very subversive, very evil, and it increases our food prices. There's a lot to it like Rockwell, who wasn't the most big brain guy in the world. You know, immediately he was more of a, you know, a bluster, you know, kind of front man politician type, but he railed on this pretty, pretty eloquently. He had, he would go, he would have pretty hot takes during his college addresses on the kosher food tax. Some of the better ones that I've heard, believe it or not, Rockwell's takes on the kosher food tax were pretty good. What do you think about that, Carl? Does that, does that comport with your understanding? Yeah, I mean, a lot of the early kosher food tax stuff is, for example, Ed Fields wrote about it in The Truth At Last and Willis Carter wrote about it in the spotlight. A lot of them don't really cover it in any detail. They just kind of talk, they kind of mention it, and then they kind of move off of it. There are, in fact, this, I've wrote, I wrote quite a long article about this, called kosher food tax to bunking the debunkers, which is basically going against the ADL's pamphlet on this and also Snopes and Boycott Watch, basically pointing out that basically Snopes and Boycott Watch basically, basically stole the entire ADL's argument and then represent it as their own, but also pointing out that basically their, their, their argument doesn't actually make any sense. And just to, it basically says, oh, because, because the, kosher food tax allegedly only produces only 0.001, like, cent on each item, therefore, that's, that's okay. But I, when, when, when you actually bother to go and work it out, for example, when you use bird's-eye data from 1980 or whatever, then what you get is you get, so they would, so per item, they were paying $2,324.40 as the Catholic's cash-up certification charge. But then you get, then, for example, an inspection would be something that would say that's going to be, that's going to be in the region of about 10 grand for one inspection. Now, often these people have these, have inspectors on site, which are paid for by the company. And there's a whole load of other things, like, for example, considering of gearing up costs, you've got to, you know, you've got to get certified, you've got to get re-certified, you've got advice, you've got, you know, preference suppliers, you've got all these kinds of things where it's, it's, when you go into it, it doesn't make any sense. And you have to remember the best, the best argument for the kosher food tax is the amount of kosher food tax organizations that, that certify it. If it wasn't profitable, there wouldn't be 40-something Jewish organizations which are doing it, would there? The simple reality is, is they've created these companies because it's profitable. And I worked, I worked out something in the region of, maybe it's the region of like, so maybe the orthodox union, which is the biggest one in the US, gets something in the region of $30 million to $200 million in one-off fees, just for this kind of thing. And it does, I kind of, it was mentioned before, but it applies to everything, it applies to, to clothing, it applies to detergent, it applies to, you know, anything, literally anything. And how it works is just, it's, it's, it's all been categorized in different books, but just getting it out into the public domain is quite hard because a lot of people don't think about it. But also, I think it needs to be considered is the fact that this has now been copied by Muslims. In, particularly in Europe, because they, because they've realized, oh, well, the Jews are making all this money from the coast, from certifying kosher food. So we're going to start doing it, certifying halal food and halal items in the same way. So now, historically, one of the ADL's arguments against it has always been, oh, the Muslims use it as well, but they don't anymore, really, they use their own. And this is, and this is why, because it's massively, massively expensive. And coming back to Frank's point about the fact that it does actually actually have a substantial cost is the fact that when you bother to read Jewish newspapers and read your sites, and you read the letters that come in, they're often, they're often whining about how expensive kosher food is. Literally, just that. I mean, I represent, I've reproduced one letter from the Jewish Chalera from May 2011, basically with a bloke called Dennis Fisher complaining about how expensive kosher food is all the time, because of, you know, all the supervision costs. For example, he says, people will tell me supervision is expensive. Do we have hordes of hibernating shawmrim worldwide who suddenly make an appearance pre-Pessach to possibly earn large amounts in a few weeks? Are rabbinim have no qualms about standing in the pulpit, exhorting the congregation to donate to the needy who can't afford to make Pessach? Why don't they ever exhort the retailers to reduce their prices, take less profits and make it easier for people to be able to keep kosher? It's that simple. When you go into it and you dig into it, that's what you find. As I said, that's all in my article, the kosher food tax debunking the debunkers on my sub-stack. Again, it's completely free. You don't have to, you don't have to do anything. Just go on there and just say, don't, you know, just go to free and then you can read it for yourselves, perfectly available. Hey, Carl, I got one thing for you and my apologies to the hands, guys. I'll make it real quick. Carl, did you ever get a chance to actually sit down and talk with Willis Cartel? No, I never met Willis Cartel. Okay, thanks. All right, Kelly J6 is next. Kelly, are you there, Kelly? All right, let's skip Kelly and go to Extra. Extra, are you there? Go ahead. I am. Hello, Thomas. And hello to the panel and hello again to Carl. I'm going to say very interesting with the halal stuff, just sorry, and kosher. Just to say that in South Africa, a few years ago, I noticed that McDonald's are certified proudly halal. So that's, that's where it is. Most people don't notice it. What I want to also just very quickly say to is that there was a person by the name of Fashberg 1933 and she does great work on Odyssey. She's called Ava Wolf on Odyssey and she has put so much videos and information. People like David Duke, William Luther Pierce, Tom Metzger, so many videos you couldn't count them all and it has been a great education to me. So anybody who would like to see so many of these video historical documents, please do. Now, one of the ones that I saw there probably on her site, sorry, on her page, was David Irving and he was talking about a man called Victor Cavendish Bentink who was the Duke of Portland and he had a couple of titles. One of them was chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee and the head of British Psychological Warfare Executive. And David Irving tells us on the video that he is quoting this Victor Cavendish Bentink as saying in a memo, which does have a Freedom of Information Act document number. I might as well read it out for the record, Freedom of Information Ordnance 0331, sorry, 0371 slash 34551. That's 0371 slash 34551. And he says, in this memo apparently, we have had a good run for our money with this gas chamber story, but you know, or that we've been putting about. It almost sounds too perfect. And he says, but don't we run the risk that we are going to be found out eventually and the collapse of that lie will collapse our entire psychological warfare program. Now, apparently this quote is gone into in greater detail or is sourced from a book called Official Secrets, what the Nazis planned and what the British and Americans knew and it's by a fellow called Richard Breitman, Biorre IT, MAN. I couldn't get a free copy PDF online, but maybe the voracious book reader Carl knows it very well. And I wonder if you could tell us a bit more about it, please. Not one I know actually, but I am very well aware of the PWE because everyone knows of SOE, Special Operations Executive, but a lot of people don't know about its cousin, the PWE, the Political Warfare Executive. And they very much are responsible for an awful lot of crap about that's written about Hitler, written about the Germans. There is a strange documentary I'd have to quickly look it up which one it is, but it's from 1999, memory serves, and just a second for Excel to open for me. It's called Sex and the Swastika from 1999 and it actually brings up PWE quite a lot and explains quite a lot about them and about what they were up to and that they were basically making up all these claims about basically the Galli to Munich having like orgies and always kind of stuff and using a fake radio set I think called Gustavs Secret Einz and so forth. But the simple reality is that you're right because a lot of the propaganda that comes from the Second World War in regards to the Germans conducting east and the alleged exterminations, one of the earliest references I know to gas chambers comes from Jews claiming that Germans were going to gas them in the 30s. It's one of the first person to find it, come of which one, which person it was, but they mentioned it as like, oh this is going to happen. But then you go into it and then if you realise that by 1940 and 41 there were already these propaganda books being circulated, these long claims of mass genocide and the one that no one knows is there is so everyone's heard of the Black Book. In fact there are three Black Books, ones from 1943, ones from 1944, and ones from 1946 and there are all variations upon a theme of this is all happening to the Jews in the east. What people don't know is that there's also the Blue Books. The Blue Books were the Polish equivalent of this in 1940 and 1941 and I actually have a Blue Book from 1941 and as well as an appendix to it which is the alleged German crimes against Roman Catholic priests which again these are all propaganda materials. They're all the same, Germans are doing all these random things, they're throwing babies up in the air, banishing people, raping nuns, you name it, they're doing it. But a real book I would encourage anyone interested in this kind of subject to read is a book really about World War I propaganda called Fossil and Wartime by Arthur Ponsonby, MP. It's a really good book to read and it's really useful to contextualise on a lot of what is then said in World War II. Why is all this kind of stuff kind of comes out of nowhere again? Whereas the Germans don't really do it, the British most certainly do and it's not the Americans, it's not even the Russians, it's the British and there and particularly the PWE who again Irving's right, they are a kind of unsung element in all this in that they're coming up with all these claims of the Germans are doing these things, the Germans are the electric floors, the death slide of book and wall that we then find out later and we've got all this kind of stuff that is just ridiculous. There's the vacuum chambers of Auschwitz and they're all the same. I've actually got some very rare British World War II propaganda, things about for example there is a mini biography of Hydra from 1942 that basically claims that he was a sexual sadist and was going around raping people and all sorts of this kind of stuff and it's written by a quote-unquote Mr. X who allegedly knew Hydra and whatever but basically all the stuff, all the claims come from these particular sources and you are right to think okay well you know a lot of this stuff is complete and utter hogwash that's just kind of become codified over time in the same way that you know there's a lot of myths that in history that over time we suddenly go well hang on a minute that's not true that can't have happened and one of the things that I actually noticed quite by accident was that you probably heard of the medieval serial killer stroke a French knight called Gildere but did you know that Gildere one of the funny things about him was that he allegedly burned children in a fire in his hearth but he was able to incinerate the corpses so basically we're seeing another version of the same thing in the medieval period of them associating Gildere with the ability to incinerate corpses with a regular fire in the same way I'm going to disappear which kind of goes into the fact that there is the debate around did Gildere actually do what they claimed he did or was it actually a argument over a land grab over basically a church land grab but yeah it's kind of interesting kind of sub point that you can just go into history head especially his weird links when you go into it. Super quick one for Carl. Top one or two books on Oswald Mosley what do you think? His biography, My Life and I can't really think of another one talking my head. That's fun. A person to talk to on that is Zuma Historian he's on YouTube and he does he's on the Eastern Bunker Mosley. He's also a Brit yeah I'm fine. Okay good stuff. Quick house cleaning guys if you guys can't this big brain guy right here who's giving everyone this beautiful entertainment education give him a follow right now his name's Carl Rattle if you guys can't everyone give him a follow and if you guys can just quickly paying attention to the numbers if you can retweet the space unretweet it and retweet it again we're only like 80 viewers behind Alex Jones hosting his debate his his open space right now so it'd be nice to crush the globalist Alex Jones over there so if you guys can retweet that'll be amazing and give Carl a follow and yeah thank you we can get back to hands. Kelly J6 are you there? All right you're getting dropped because you're not around. Bruce hello everyone from Germany hello Carl um my question for you is what is your opinion about Hitler's second book um written by yeah I'm back. Hello can you hear me? It's not your turn Kelly. Oh I'm sorry I thought you asked a question. Well I did I did but we moved on just we'll come back to you after Bruce. Okay so Zweiter's book is um a for those who don't know is the alleged successor to Mein Kampf written in the late 1920s allegedly however it is not genuine and the reason this is not we can say it's not genuine is because the only evidence that was ever written by Hitler is a signed affidavit in English which is typewritten not signed but is typewritten by a low level Franz Ehrwerlag which is the Nazi publishing house employee that's the only evidence it's entered the Hitler and of course Gerd Weinberg just happens to find this at the start of his career and then he promotes it and basically then he there's a bunch of real claim it's real but the reality is the providence isn't there to claim it could be Hitler don't get me wrong it could be but there's no evidence that it is yeah and certainly nothing that would really stand up um to a serious serious serious consideration in fact a lot of a lot of hit and barkers don't even use it so for precisely this reason okay i just asked because some historians claim it's more accurate and displays a better picture about Hitler than Mein Kampf and that's why i asked no it's completely understandable but again it could be Hitler we know Hitler allegedly there is some mention that Hitler was writing something around this time but we have no evidence that it is um and and with with the absence of evidence we have to conclude that it's probably not Hitler but um it could be it's i mean they might something something might turn up and says oh by the way Hitler did write zed so i just bought if so great because that means that Hitler was very was very very o-fail with certain philosophy which which counters another common claim against him that he wasn't widely read or well read hey another quick one for you carl uh what's your knowledge on is there any books on Hitler's artwork like just is there anybody who's studied that in depth and not that i know um i wouldn't be surprised if there was but there's so much there's so much on him that i don't think that's been said in any detail i don't think anyone has really wanted to go there because they'll get accused of being pro-hidler um but as far as i know no but i don't quote me on it there's plenty of stuff that's around on his on his art just not and nothing system i've actually i've actually held the hitler original that that's owned by a family friend he made me put on gloves uh and it was authentic about i cross-referenced it with the auction that he bought it in um and it was surprisingly affordable it wasn't inexpensive um but it also wasn't a Picasso so yeah it's kind of amazing how i think it's fetching more Hitler starts fetching more but it's not insanely overpriced which is remarkable to me no i mean to give you some context i right next to it at the moment i have a 1932 painting of the original Berghof before it was transformed into something else by an s.a man and um and it's uh verified by hammock hofman hitler's personal photographer very nice but you've got for 50 good on any day even better i'm i'm sure i'm sure it's worth a little bit more now yeah it's more people people didn't know what they had and i recognized it and it was like hang on a minute Simon hello hey carl um i was gonna ask you what your opinions are on the authors ernt snolpey and carl schmidt carl schmidt is uh one of the best one of the finest legal legal political philosophy that for the minds of the 20th century um by all means um ernt snolpey is a was a german thinker who sorry he tried to give a lot of context to german attitudes in world in the lead up to world war two and the lead up to the macro socialism's revolution can you give me feedback if someone's got their mic open please shake your mic everyone shake your mic okay um so the key thing to understand with him is that he was an early proponent of the idea that um that it arrived it arose as an answer to communism and which is that there's a lot of truth in that but also he was another proponent of the idea which is later come later came about via ernt's top ish um in and has been validated by a lot of other people for example um was it shawarma meakin in his salens war uh victor sorov in his the chief culprit and icebreaker that basically um salen and salen was no different to lenin in that in lenin trotsky he was just taking time before he invaded people invaded and the natural socialism wasn't met since a response to communism and to particularly the period of the early 1920s when there was a series of jewish led um communist revolts which in hungary in germany in um to the extent in britain you had some in france you had you had you had poland you had all sorts in hungary all sorts going on as this time at this time so in essence that's that's what ernt's nullt is talking about but carl smith's one of these people that if you read carl smith's books uh you they're not very long but you will read about 10 pages and you'll have to kind of start researching terms because what are because of what he's talking about so he's one of these people that if you're gonna read him um i would seriously recommend reading him slowly yeah i uh i i actually read concept of the political when when i when i really didn't know a whole lot yeah and so this past week and i mean it's only 70 pages long and uh i just i couldn't believe how dense it was i mean it's like reading play-doh he just there's really not there's not very much um how would i put he just doesn't waste words yeah oh i was just gonna say anyways hey thanks carl uh thanks for your work on simon trint simon of trint and and everything you do man that's a problem the only thing i was gonna add was that was that carl smith was very much the man who created the third rike legally and constitutionally he was the man he was a theorist who came up with the ideas in 1920s in his book the crisis of parliamentary democracy where he advocated for what he called the state of the exception and how it works and he basically he basically craced it and then in 1933 he was the one who codified it and made the third rike into what it became and legally and gave gave all the powers and he also authored one of the best criticisms of liberalism that has ever been written and that's not my words that's the words of quite a few historians of ideas kaley thank you so much for allowing me to speak sorry i'm driving through rural areas having mic issues but carl um what an honor to share this space thank you so much for just dedicating so much of your life and then choosing to share this lifelong dedication with us thank you for the pant to the panel for hosting you amongst the other feats of tireless effort they put into 1488 radio i would love to ask um about hitler's religiosity about his disillusionment perhaps with the catholic church left to forgive my limited knowledge i've only read my income twice i listened on audiobook and then now i'm reading through again and taking notes and um it's i did not even learn about the subversion of the catholic church by the jews until just recently i'm also co coinciding with my comp i'm also reading um dr martin luther's uh the jews and their lies i don't practice Catholicism anymore but i would be considered a Protestant now and i'm curious if you have any other references on that um it is sort of what i'm gleaning in my comfort that you know he was so devout as a child um but that faith obviously didn't leave him especially in his days as an artist thank you for referencing that radio because i wanted to bring that up as well his paintings of the Madonna and the child are so beautiful and so we don't hear much about him as far as his spiritual faith practice um but i just find it hard to imagine who would completely abandon like monotheism christianity christ especially because that was ingrained in him at such a young age but if you have any references or personal take on that i would love to hear it and again thank you so much what an honor to share this space with you sir okay i kind of brought the kind of clouds earlier but um the key thing to understand about Hitler religious religious is yes you're right he grew up in a very even religious household i wouldn't say the most religious household the most religious person there were two religious Nazis who grew up in most religious households were actually gerbils and himmler by an absolute country mile both of them um whereas Hitler grew up in a very i would say uh they would they would be church going but not very how many kids did himmler have carl ran one yeah whereas gerbils had like a whole a whole he had like a whole slew like seven yeah he had like six two or five six um yeah so yeah and um so his hitler religiosity he very much um if you want to understand that then it's a very much a contextual thing it's not necessarily what's written in my camp it's not necessarily what's in damaris's collective works it's understanding what he's talking about in the context he's talking about it so the article i've kind of mentioned before is uh togwin's 2018 uh hitlers worldview and the in the interworld cultural camp where he summarizes a lot of literature on this and particularly makes the point of um some of the studies of it like for example that munich was at the time a center of what was called reform catholicism where it was a very radical it was like a radical nationalist version of catholicism this was in the wake of course of the bavarian sceve republic that was again dominated by jews and had committed various atrocities most famously actually they actually shot a lot shot a bunch of leaders of the thul society rather oddly um but the interesting thing about that is that when we talk about hitler and his religiosity uh we can't really apply modern standards because it's a very specific context in a very specific time there's a lot of very specific intellectual currents going around like even example um if you if you went back in history today and you told someone about christian zionism you know the the scruffial bible and all that stuff they wouldn't believe you they wouldn't understand because to them it's like well no you can't do that this this doesn't work but to us it's the same we're looking back trying to understand context so again i would recommend that article is just a general good guide to understanding some of the context of what hitler's talking about and particularly in regard to what we call confessionalism saying basically you are german first and foremost you are arian you are not primarily catholic protestant pagan you are german and what he's saying you remember we must remember is that for example this is in the wake of the catholic center party so the catholic center party is putting the pope's interests or catholic interest first then you've got um your los fond rom movement in from german pro say german catholics becoming german protestants because of the because the because the catholics were considered to be potentially loyal to roam of germany and you've also got business marks called tulicam against the catholics so you have all the stuff going on and you have to remember again that a lot of what the germans were reigning against in the 1920s which is where by the way martin ballman gets his atheism from was the fact that there was a lot of contradictions in society for example homosexuality was was illegal in prussia had been illegal in prussia and germany since the 1870s but was practically unenforced this law was practically unenforced by the by the by the um by the first law board and you have the rise of homosexuality you had the rise of all these things and all you had all these christians deploring it and saying how awful it is they weren't doing anything about it and that's what they're fundamentally talking about is that people they're not actualizing their faith and that's what hitler in many respects in mass socialism is about it's about action dealing with problems dealing with issues you know not just talking about it we're going to go down there we're going to go burn the institute for sexual reform you know and and magna's magna's hershfeld's museum of sex aka his old dildo collection basically um which is exactly what it was um and so then you get you've got this context use the con so that context will help you understand what you're reading but also um it comes back to um hitler had a very good relationship with um the some of the christian denominations i would say the catholics were the least um supportive but they were still pretty supportive in general i mean german protestants in particular were a very key nsda ap um voting bloc um they're very keen on it because they felt they actually um they were they were actually great christian values as you may or may not know djut bonhoeffer gets a lot of talked about did you know he actually originally voted for the msda ap in 93 and he encouraged his flock to do the same thing he probably didn't know that but people people didn't talk about it very much but that's actually who was that carl could you repeat the bonhoeffer you know the um the famous guy who's opposed hitler was a christian interesting yeah what was the relationship between pious and the rike um different um in that uh there was the concordat between the catholic church and the third rike but it's often said that the third rike broke it actually as the catholic church that broke it because the catholic church had all these jesuits that were denouncing um for example they were denouncing the third rike from the pulpit and the the germans took it as well hang on a minute you know you've just broke you know we've just got an agreement with you you don't interfere with politics we don't interfere with your fate with with the practice of catholicism or rest priests was was pious and nazi was was he as big of a sympathizer as he's led to be no he's not a city well he wasn't a sympathizer he wasn't a sympathizer but he was he was supportive of some things for example the fight against communism but the catholic church the catholic church has quite a lot to answer for in the second world war in particular jesuit order um because they're part of the reason that spain pulled out of of russia at key time um was partly the catholic church and also the catholic church was very close to the christel circle which is the conservative resistance who tried to bomb hitler in july 44 which is why we see from july 44 we see this rise in broadly anti christian sentiment in the rike because um a bunch of overt christians had inadvertently used christianity to try and argue that they should kill hitler um in 1944 um and then basically basically they would not they would just come to some quite a weird arrangement with communism rather than fight it so yeah that's where that comes from and that's where that's you know just how it is uh what was the second bit of that question i don't think there was a second bit i think we're just peppering with questions because you're goddamn encyclopedia carl uh yeah i mean just like oh i think it was um it was a little bit hitler i can't remember what it was oh it was martin luther was brought up okay so well that's kind of to divert a little bit on him um but people don't know this but there's hit uh luther wrote four anti-jewish works not one everyone knows um on the jews and their lives but there's three others i can't stop me remember that remember the top of my head um they are in his um in the collections of his works you just need i just need to go find the actual titles of them but some context to them is that luther famously wrote for jesus christ was a jew at the start of his career as a reformer arguing that um a positive attitude and kindness towards the jews would be it was a good idea because jews was jewish in his in his argument but luther then discovers this this doesn't work that um the truth is is jews is that the jews are not listening to luther and this is where a lot of people say oh yeah but luther was just jealous he was just upset with them no he wasn't what luther was responding to and what and the reason why on the jews and their lives was written was that he had been um he was he started getting letters from a man called rabbi josephal of rossenheim who was basically um basically trying to get luther's convert to judaism and basically to tell his followers to convert judaism and um he responds to it and he gets really angry with him and uh he then writes on the jews and their lives to as a response to to rabbi josephal of rossenheim and then jup rabbi josephal of rossenheim goes starts going to the um authority the the the the king the the prince authorities to try and get on the jews and their lives banned so yeah that's a kind of little bit of weird history of martin luther that people don't often know you said there's three or four books total including yeah yeah there's there's four of them on the jews and their lives it's the last one got you why is that so widely unknown probably because um on the jews and their lives is the most strident of them the other three are really more theological whereas on the jews and their lives is just a broad condemnation of judaism and jews in general that's probably why um one of them is called the semphorath which is basically an argument against jewish mysticism the couple of the other ones are at the top of my head i do i had did a post of them a while back and i started translating them but um or so i find in the english translations often to publish them with a with a text what's what's the origin is it latin or what are the yeah they're all they're all originally in latin um i need to go and find the names but i can um so sorry to interrupt you you did say the name the semphorath i'd have to i'd have to find you the actual um uh i'd have to find it one second i know the name you muted the whole space man yep so what was that carl sorry i'm just i'm just gonna go see if i can find the particular um the particular books i'm trying to get this egg straight up it's wasn't part of your backstab boom i bet if we retitled kosher tax to a jew tax it would infuriate people more which is what it is it's a jewish religion it's a judaism tax it's not a kosher tax it's a judaism tax or you know you know they call it kosher in effect it's a judaism tax sentiment hi guys uh sorry about my hand earlier zeus i every time i put it up it went down and so i didn't mean to be flashing it forgive me um my question is is how do they how is the jewish narrative so consistent for so long forgive me if this is a bit of a lowbrow question but hearing the six million number published before quite before world war two all the way up till 18 years ago when they were parading an elderly woman around my junior high with her holocaust tattoo and pushing that narrative there seems to be this ages long initiative that is it carried through oral tradition and what are we missing that we could keep our own knowledge moving in a consistent manner because it seems like we're so often blind to all of this thank you so much this has been an absolute delight i'm so grateful you're lending us your time and wisdom that i've gotten more education today than i have in my entire public school time so thank you no problem i just to come back to the four books of luthers which are anti-jewish it's his commentary on the Psalms then you have on the Jews and their lives then you have vom sechem hamfolas which is vom space sc hem space h a m p h o r a s and then warning against the Jews those are his four books against the Jews okay so sorry could you repeat your question sorry i've just kind of lost it in my mind uh forgive me um i'm at work just a second here um so my question is is like how how is the initiative from the Jewish people like so continuous all the way from me hearing about the number six million being published before world war two to 18 years ago when i was in junior high and there was a woman that had her holocaust tattoo on and they were pushing propaganda there it seems like they have a very strong ability to maintain their propaganda and what might we learn from how they operate to keep a keep the knowledge of what's going on on our side of the fence okay so okay so we've got two a bunch of different stuff there first of all the six million number um now i ever i have an unusual theory on this most people will tell you it's cabala it's this that's that i don't think so i i don't know if people think that but i don't think it is there is a concept in Judaism that's not very well known called a gusma it's literally means exaggeration it's a concept in rabbinics what it means is that basically in order to express the scale of a showa event now you might remember that shoa means catastrophe and the bit and the shoa is the holocaust so basically um in order to express the scale of a showa event jews or rabbis will take the number of israelite who came out who the talmud says came out of um egypt with moses and multiply that so traditionally that would be say so that's the number that came out of israel so egypt with moses is alleged to be 600 000 and then multiplication um so he's one two and then oh by the way if it turns by 10 we get six million but where did where was that come where did that figure come from well if you read mar if you read um don hedgesheimers book the i think 2003 the first holocaust he traces it back to the 1880s and yeah i'd agree with that it that's when we start seeing a lot of it and the key person to know about this is a man called lucy and wolf who is a major jewish propagandist in britain um he writes a series he writes a series of magazines and articles promoting the idea um that russia that the programs in russia that the russian government's evil and so forth um but he's one of the people who come up with this he starts using this figure called the six the six million he claims his population statistic however the six million appears quite much earlier than that it appears around the damaskus richard murder trial in 1840 when all of a sudden this figure just pops out of nowhere it just pops out of nowhere and all of a sudden we've got um western jews talking to you know eastern jews so basically you've got ash you've got separdin who are the jews like claude montefiol and you've got ashkanazim from like germany and um from france talking to miss rachim so these are all three groups of jews but they're but they're all very very different and they're all various different let they've all got various different intellectual traditions now the miss rachim have a much older tradition and they've they've been stuck in you know um damaskus for uh you know for a thousand years say they've been stuck there for a thousand years and they've got a lot of traditional positions and thoughts that circular western shepardi jews don't understand one of which would be a gusma so all of a sudden we start seeing this this claim that there are six million jews that are going to be threatened by this by by this by this by this happening and my suggestion is that it's in fact a gusma that's been misunderstood so it's a rabbi going this 1840 ritual murder trial it's 10 times worse than uh moses coming out of egypt with the israelites but then it's taken by people like lucian wolf to mean oh it's actually a population statistic and you know it's threatening it's threatening the use of russia and the truth is it's not it's just someone's someone's misunderstood something and then it and all of a sudden the six million statistic is is a is a jewish population statistic in russia in the 1880s and all of a sudden it becomes you know it turns up in the in the first world before the first world war after the first world war and then again in the 1940s when it becomes the figure of the holocaust but when we talk about people you have people coming around and people saying all this stuff to your school the truth is is that it's not hard to challenge them on this stuff you just have to enlist you do all you have to know is some basic holocaust history because as i've done repeatedly on my sub stack if you just read what they say it's half the time it doesn't make any sense of according to the history because if you look at it a lot of the holocaust survivors quote unquote don't know what the official positions are they just used to being formed over as they just say whatever they think or whatever they've heard and they come up with always weird wonderful claims like and like most of them claim to have seen Joseph Mengele been personally selected by him or you know and then you get the really weird stuff like the woman who who who hides diamonds in a renaissance then you got the woman who claims she was raised by wolves and it turned out it was wasn't true there's other ones where they claimed to have lived in the pit for three years there was one there's one woman who claims that she crossed the entire eastern front twice so she so so she wandered so she left Poland wanted to wanted to Russia during World War two and then wandered all the way back to Germany during World War two it's like how how on earth would you achieve that you just wandered through the biggest war in human history and you just no one noticed apparently that she was just wandering around so if you just so when you listen to these people just if you know a little bit of holocaust history you can really just very quickly get them to contradict themselves and show that they're just basically spouting crap or at the very least they're being dishonest or adding things in or whatever it is but as to why they're so persistent it's because they have the one thing about them that is quite interesting and quite bizarre is this concept of Hootspur so they feel that it's this you know this great big thing that they've they've been massively wronged and they're going to talk about it so the Titan cows kind of but it's also because it gets them so much I mean think about it they get built they've got billions and billions out of the out of the out of the Germans out of different companies they've got them out of the French Braille ways they've got it out of IBM they've got it out of Switzerland you name it they've done it they've they've they've tried to go off they've gone after IG Farben they've you know you name it they've they've they've shook they've shook down so many people and if you really want to read into this it would be a Norman Finkelstein's book the holocaust industries are really good to this general rundown that the craziness that goes on so but why one's it persistent because they can be no one is contradicting them no one dares no one dares to say oh by the way this is complete nonsense you know you need to justify this instead they just believed so you'll get the inevitable ridiculous stuff that comes out and that's simply it it's just they they're doing it because they can and no one no one's contradicting them I mean look at the response to the Israeli response to the October 7th stuff throughout the time they've just lied the whole time they've lied and they've lied and they've lied they they claim they didn't do have they could they claim that they didn't do the Hannibal doctrine now it's turned out they did they did a mass Hannibal doctrine well they were actually been called out on their lives post 10 7 and um there's so much control that they don't care I mean that honestly I was amazed there was IDF guys coming out a week after 10 7 saying this is an impossibility and it just nothing happens yeah nothing happens yeah I mean it definitely happens but you have to remember that what is some that is one of these is one of these moments um I would say within these moments there's something fundamentally changes something changed on on 7th of October last year when because fundamentally yeah the yeah mass attacked but then the Israeli response to it's been so psychotic and it's just been so counter counter to reality it's working people up because basically you've got me hating saying things like um Israel it's it's like America doesn't America doesn't need America America needs Israel I mean what kind of lunacy is that it's also going to be interesting to see how hard they push the anniversary I think that's going to be very telling on how confident they are in the narrative on how hard they push it I think I think they didn't care at this point I think they're just pushing it they're just pushing it because I think they can and they said that's what it is it well it's effectively unopposed we don't have they can they control the media apparatus in the west so whatever they whatever international jury says is is yeah hey car really quick how much time do we have with you we don't want to monopolize your time here I can probably do another 30 minutes if that's okay okay yeah I think we have some hands for you yeah sure hey Edgar thank you Susan yes there is a problem with the hands certainly on android anyway so please don't give us the Glasgow kiss too quickly give us a little bit okay oh can you hear me okay yeah I'm sure you know extra oh I'm so sorry I'll come up next yeah okay sorry guys it's okay Edgar yeah sorry about that guys um a bit of a normie fag question for you here I do apologize I'm just coming into a lot of the knowledge and you know the 109 expulsions I was wondering if maybe you have like a top three for you know reasons of your own that you could speak on and thanks so much I'll drop down okay so um it's when we talk about this bolsters 109 really isn't correct um someone who wasn't me went through this a lot more and they think they worked out it's something in the region of five to six hundred it's nothing it's nowhere near 109 um but if you want a top three I'll give you three examples of when sort of thing has happened one is the 1190 sack sack of the the killing of the Jews at Clifford Tower in York in England medieval England that's when basically the base that basically what happened was the so the King Richard I had been just been crowned as king and a bunch of people thought there was a because the Jews the Jews had turned up in London and had uh hadn't basically uh were doing deference to King Richard and uh they this was interpreted as an insult by the crowd the crowd then um went and started started beating up the drag the Jews outside and started beat them up but then people then saw this and thought it was a thought it was a sign of a general rising against the Jews and so they decided okay well then it went out to various different places in cities and whatnot but the most notable one happened in York and so York is a major city in the north of England one of the major places in the north of England then as now and basically all the people rose up as one against the Jews and the Jews went and hid in the uh what we call the it was the tower it's the main stone tower at the time I think it was the I think it was a stone tower I'm not sure if it was the stone or if it would but but basically they hid there and because the reason they hid there was because Jews were considered royal property and because they're royal property um and that was a royal castle they could be um uh they they would be protected by the king so they hid there and the reason they hid there was because the because the um the locals were going off the debt registers because it's often not stated but the Jews were the wealthiest people um in medieval England and in a lot of medieval countries they were the wealthiest people um so you had a situation where they were rising the people rose against them uh the Jews then kicked the uh constable of the tower out um because they you know they were paranoid so he got upset he got a bunch of knights and they all you know they were they were besieging them so um so one Jew then convinced all the other Jews to commit suicide um they set fire at the tower they then commit suicide and then they um and then and then basically this other Jew uh I think this other Jew survived and um because basically they were told you are going to be baptized or you're going to die um so they decided they were going to commit um what they call Kidosh Hashem which is Jewish martyrdom and then basically again it was a popular vote of the people against the Jews another example of this is in the Bavarian town of Degendorf in 1337 it's sometimes it's come sometimes called the Degendorf Gadd um basically it was a what happened was so Degendorf had a had a big fire as a lot the thought of town burnt down so the um so the locals uh essentially took loans took they took loans to rebuild the town they took them from the Jews on the assumption okay we'll pay it back with the harvest then they have two bad harvests in a row then the Jews rather than being understanding criticism the Jews then call them their debts and the the Bavarian locals get really angry and they and they burn and they go on they go on a pogrom and they go on a rampage killing killing Jews and driving them out of Degendorf and it's and it was considered a shame these days but it's considered historically been considered a very good thing and a bit it's a classic bit of um anti-Jewish class warfare another example and we're going to fast forward all the way to I think it's 17th century Ukraine where we have um Chilmiki Chiumaniki who's a leader of the Cossacks and the so the Ukraine at this point is under Polish control so the Polish uh Polish Commonwealth controls it the Poles um have a middle class and that middle class is all Jewish now a common thing to mistake people make is they assume that the um that Jews were just money lenders in fact they were most frequently tax farmers and what tax farming is for the those you don't know is basically when a prince said oh king says to you okay so king says I'm going to I'm going to I said I want to I want to raise taxes but I want money now so if you give me money if you give me the amount of taxes that tax money that I I think I would raise then you can have the privilege of raising taxes for me but what this means in practice is they simply go off and they um so the Jews go off they pay them pay the pay the Polish king money they then go to the Ukrainians the Ukrainian people in the Cossacks and they say basically you are as taxes and of course it's not the same amount of tax that the kid that they've given the king it's more so they're making a profit on this and these these these these taxes and these tax farmers and the Taurus are basically taking huge amounts of money from people and eventually this this triggers a massive revolt from the Cossacks called the Tumil-Nikki revolt and this is the this is one of the original showers because thousands of Jews were were hung were hung slaughtered and killed in very quite um nasty ways by these very very angry angry Ukrainians um so much so that if you read books if you read if you read um Jewish histories before the Holocaust you will see this where we can see this this event called the show because that's what that's how bad it was and how much it scarred them so again you got another instance where Jews Jewish behavior is actually triggering a massive almost class-based revolt and again of course the Marxists don't want to talk about that they said they want to talk about oh there's other economic vague causes rather than you're just being a straight up um ethnic revolt against Jewish oppression does that make sense when was that uh a time frame uh 1650 1660s um if you know the um author Gogol the the Russian literature literary figure Gogol he writes about that in his um Teres Bulba which is worth reading hey Thomas Hedgkins going to walk with me call the next person Patrick all right hey how's it going guys absolute pleasure to uh come on and speak with you Carl I'm really impressed with uh level and depth of knowledge it's truly impressive uh I got two things I wanted to bring up one I actually uh was getting into it with somebody recently and I was looking up stories uh pre-war war two of the six million Jew allegations and I actually found a compilation of 200 separate printed stories most of them in the New York Times of six million Jew allegations in there but pretty wild I could uh send it to you I guess uh second thing I'm just curious I mean I'm kind of going back to the conversation you guys were talking earlier about mistakes uh Nazi Germany may have made in uh World War II you know and I grew up in the 90s and early 2000 watching the history channel and there's just non-stop you know Germans World War II footage I mean just basically endlessly all day long and uh I remember as a kid I used to wish I could go back in time and uh tell the Germans that their enigma their ciphers were being listened to and you know uh read and basically the allies knew you know the last couple years basically everything the Germans were doing before they did it you know to a large extent anyways I'm just curious uh your feelings on that and or if that's just all bullshit the allies might made up I guess that was kind of another thing I was thinking too if it was just a bunch of horseshit or if it's actually true and um I guess your feelings aren't all okay well that's perfectly true the the allies had basically cracked enigma um but what is not known is to know so well is that the um the people who really cracked it weren't really the British it was the Poles the Poles actually had an idea how the Pol a poll actually worked out how to crack enigma I think in 1936 or 1937 um so and a lot of it was not the homosexual Alan Turing no no that's not that that was the British bloke he the bloke the bloke guy created created um computers no but it was a poll I can't remember his name was on the head but um the Poles the Poles actually cracked enigma in 1936-1937 in fact he was one of the guys who um uh won the Jewish adventure myths um like debunked he was the actual guy who came up with a lot of who came up with the actual theory behind it and it just happened to be oh he's the guy who also came those guys also worked out how to crack enigma but yeah the the yes the enigma was being uh was cracked but also it's worth mentioning that not all not so not all versions of enigma were correct until later okay because they're they're they're different they're different numbers of rotors they're different codes so there is there so they they weren't reading everything but they're really but by the end of the war they're reading most of it um and it's also not well known as a kind of like throw something in there as a bit of a fun fact that um mi5 ran a operation uh during world war two uh to basically they ran a fake german intelligence network in britain and they were genuinely shocked about how many how much how much pro how many pro germans there were in the in the in britain at the time which again is not often mentioned and it was run by one but I think it was a Rothschild he ran it and that was for either pwe or sw i think or so we um and yeah it's just an interesting little fact that you've hit you that despite Britain being the country that you know the country that was supposed to be really anti-german really wasn't I mean a lot of britain a lot of britans weren't that opposed to germany to the extent where um there's a book called by martin dockety called um Nazi wild propaganda in world war two and he talks about this he talks about basically britain a bit of british saying british uh british intelligence and times to the home office talking about basically a lot of britans were listening to german radio and they more than they agreed with an awful lot of what the germans had to say and more than they usually came to so I'm just curious you're going back to that so how big of a role do you think that played in the german defeat I guess is kind of the end point what I was getting at and I appreciate your answer a lot so is that just really that just means that's the really static key for me oh can you hear me I can I just get my little static I apologize I was just asking how large of a role do you think the enigma codes being cracked do you think that played in germany's defeat I guess is I was curious I don't think you played a big role okay that's why I was curious okay no that's yeah so that's why I said earlier I said you know if people if people want to get into world war two I would really read john mosie's death ride just because it's a really good book which deals with a lot of the myths to do with the war right and and also kids kind of kind of brings up a lot of stuff it but it it may affect us on eastern front but a lot of it comes like you brings a lot of stuff about the west and front and other fronts like for example that kind of thing but if you want another weird fact you know the people bring up things like the german occupation of dan denmark and norway in 1940 what people don't often do is they don't realize that there was a reason the germans did that because the germans who got wind of a british operation called called r4 now operation r4 was a was a church or sanctioned operation that was going to be launched and but the germans pipped the bridge to the to the to the thing to the to what to what was going on so that essentially r4 would have been the british the british army would have invaded norway just you know to straight invade that you know no no attempt to pretend otherwise and then they would invade sweden so the entire point was that they were going to they were going to they were going to invade further and then they were going to occupy from there so again that's a little bit of a tip that's really quite useful i think is anyway and also the fact that they also invaded iceland and all other things and that pole that cracked the dingma was probably obviously a polish commie i'm assuming well thank you for your answer carl i appreciate a lot thank you you have a great day i don't sorry i don't think thomas is say thank you for your answer i appreciate a lot carl thank you you have a great day thank you i'm not sure where we are with hands i know zeus had to take a leave real quick and ht was supposed to take his i think it's extra i think extra has his hand up well maybe you like one or two more because i think carl's got to check out here in a few minutes okay go ahead extra shoot your shot thank you very much um yeah well uh you mentioned iran zisblatt that was the diamond defecator and also rachel hanan was the woman who literally said they used to make baloney out of us every night and we'd have to eat the baloney they made out of us and also like very like uh you know forest gump she said then in the mornings we'd go to the showers and you never knew whether you were going to get gas or water you never knew what you were going to get like i mean literally so ridiculous and preposterous so i'm so glad i know the agusma or agusma yeah agusma word now and there's no cost ever to their lives being found out and it is as you know carl said earlier uh it's it's basically people want to know what the correct answer is they don't look into it and they know the correct answer and there's a lot of social shame about it and then they when they have the hold they have over our countries now then they just make it illegal to question in case you ever might think about it and um but i wanted to redirect slightly if that's all right um and ask about because i'm not sure if it came up already um about the possible surviving sons and daughters of people like himler gorbals and hitler himself and iceman now hitler seems to have had possibly a son called a french son by a french woman maybe it was during world war one called gene or genre lorette but died in 1987 i think or something along those lines and also it said that like gorbals had three daughters and said that they went to or sorry that they all died in a bunker in 1945 but some people think they got to argentina and i think i remember seeing that uh perhaps they were adopted by somebody in the usa uh and maybe also himler's son might have been adopted in the usa so i just i know it comes into the territory of conspiracy theories uh iceman maybe had a son also that was adopted in the usa um if there's anything cold hard fact that he knows about i mean for example i think that the french son did do a blood test and it did come up as a match for hitler so are there any cold hard facts you might have about any of the sons of hitler or daughters of hitler in the usa or iceman or himler or gorbals please okay so first of all the hitler thing the hitler thing is so that you're right is genre the claim is john marie lorette um who claims he had a his mother had an affair with hitler during world war one um but we but there's there was there was initially some interest and thought that it could be genuine turns out that it's almost certainly not because hitler um wasn't in the wasn't in the actual area at the time as far as they can work out so it's unlikely to have been hitler and his mother probably just told him that because you know wants to be famous or wants to justify her affair with german soldier during world war one as to um let me see as to someone like gering his daughter patina gering um i think this is daughter is his granddaughter which uh she is very much you know of the she she she parades around about the holocaust all the time and those are that stuff but it's just the standard you know it's standard basically pts almost ptsd gorbals his children did dine a bunker there's no evidence they ever went to south america they died there we know they died there we know we know who poisoned them um but then you've got people like eichmann i'm not sure he had any children he might well have done because he was in south america uh we know mingalee um i think mingalee was in contact with his father in south america for a while um not sure about anyone else stuck in my head but i know that the bormons the bormon children were you know basically made a whole um industry out of being martin bormons children and apologizing and well that's the other one who's done a lot of it is katrina himmler who is the nisa feiner kimmler and uh she was very she's she's married from israeli she's believes all sorts of no carl say it ain't so no she's married from israeli oh carl sorry but she's the but the the context of that is that she is that him i had daughter um goodran who was a natural socialist till the day of her death a few years ago yeah i'm familiar with her aka goodran berwitz what's her name but that's pretty much it in terms of the children um occasionally you'll you'll find you'll find um you'll you'll find kids of the of german figures who will um come out and say oh my um my my grandfather was horrible because um i'm sure you've all heard of arman guath the uh comment of the blood cell from shins list his granddaughter is half black so yeah and of course she makes a whole song and dance about it saying oh my grandfather would have killed me so yeah yeah yeah that's all the stuff around um the kids it's a tough break but i cannot say that i'm surprised um yeah i mean i mean i can't i don't know what happened to rosenberg's um daughter but i know that um they were helped by still a hilfer the german organization and i don't know what happened to them though yeah i think even if there are some bright spots we're probably better off not even talking about it yeah you know gonna you're not gonna get into positives for that one yeah unfortunately well i i don't know if um i don't see any hands i got a quick question real quick okay if you want to if you want to fire one off before you wrap it real quick oh you're so you come from the British side of history no offense i had a quick question like all along his daughter in the organization she uh hang on champ hang on champ hold on hold on there right here so is there a german guy who who's it's uh you know well read as you where where you guys kind of go back and forth like is there a guy out there that you might like debate with on this topic where he's like no you got this wrong and have you meant in terms of what what topic like i just don't hit learn the national socialism is there it like word do you have any sort of arch nemesis within the academic world carl no not really yeah i didn't think so because guys wouldn't want to debate you i have to think um i have to i've had a call a lot of debates in my time with people but usually what i find is that they're um either they're they're very straight so they just basically have a very surface level understanding of things or they um or they basically result to um oh i'm a great authority on this believe me so uh you if you're if you see me on actually you might see me chatting with people like j j otto paul who's a uh bonafide press of history or was a press of history he's written three books on the persecution of the Germans but um Germans and ethnic minorities by Stalin and he was black ball of academia in 1999 for basically christine deborah leibstadt so but there's it just give you an idea there are people out there who have who are like within academia who are on the who are on the level but it's just the fact that they had to be quite careful quite a lot of time is your have you ever had a career in academia carl yeah i'm in academia oh got you see so you actually have a teaching gig now yeah wow i'm not even gonna ask where um but for you yeah um i've kept that secret for nine on uh 10 15 years and we'll keep it that way we'll keep it that way um well you've been generous with your time i think we've taken up more than enough of it um i don't know if you've been kind of closing words before we uh cut you loose again you've been generous with your time and i know a lot of people appreciate you doing this with us i mean i don't only have much i don't need much to close other than to say the best thing you can do if you're really interested in the subject is pick up a pick up a few pick up a few books or pick an area of history um that you think you want to know what you want to say more about and just i just to start digging but if you want help you want to know something you can always at me on x i usually respond if i don't respond immediately it's because notifications don't always come up so if you do that then let me know and then i can point you in the right direction or i can point you to someone who might know um but yeah i mean i'm always happy to talk to people or help out or correct or help but if you've got a general question you don't understand something because there's a lot of it um then always happy to help and just you know don't be it don't be afraid of literature because nine times out of ten a you'll learn more but b you will become better for it for learning wise words carl well we thank you greatly especially doing this in prompt two um which is even more impressive and uh you uh you i think you lived up to expectations so we really appreciate it yeah i'm more than happy to come back in different times it's no it's no problem at all excellent thanks so much yeah thank you all right bye guys take care buddy real quick um make sure all of you guys give carl a follow and check out his sub stack as you can tell he's a plethora of knowledge and um you should utilize it so check out his sub stack read some of his work i'm sure it's very beneficial to you if you do so yeah i mean listen there's other revisionists i mean erving's on this platform he's he's an old man now and it's it's a literally a miracle that he's still alive which you know i hope he lives forever but he won't um but i'd say carl's the most active historical revisionist that isn't our camp figuratively speaking and doesn't toe the marxist line um on this platform to my knowledge i don't know if anyone quite is accredited and um active so he's kind of at the top of the heap on this platform so um yeah i've always thought highly of his takes but also follow david erving too and any other historical revisionists on this platform um whose names escape me but um because they're not a lot of them are not on here so anybody got a hand up also not all of them are allowed on here that's the other thing there's some guys who are too spicy and they don't want to do alts and such so my hand is my hand has been up okay go ahead mister sorry radio didn't mean to cut you out i'm good we can get the hands burn through them yeah thanks for having me on kind of bummed out i didn't get to talk to carl but that's okay i can ask him the question i had uh via dms or whatever he's very good at uh answering people by the way i think that's been covered though um yeah man so what i wanted to ask him but was it was really for the benefit of the community has to do with um just his prodigious intellect and his um you know the steel trapped mind his photographic memory and uh if you listened long enough you heard him address um you know just how much he reads and sort of his process but what i was going to ask him but i will offer up to the community as uh it was just something that you could explore and check into i was going to ask him if he'd ever heard of a man named carl lumen a german um who came up with a system for processing information and and and keeping track of what you what you learn and then um being able to enter weave that knowledge together so that it's actually useful to you uh uh a lot of people call his concept i think he called it uh the zettel castan uh which is spelled z as in zebra uh e tt el k a s t en zettel castan uh some people call it a slip box but um anyway like after collecting notes for a while and the way that most people do uh commenting on the margins of text like carl says he does or collecting handwritten notes by uh by topic uh lumen realized that his note taking was not leading anywhere so he turned uh note taking on its head instead of adding notes to exist how do you spell lumen l u m e n no i'm sorry uh it's l u h m a n n nick less n i k l a s nick less lumen um and so like instead of adding these notes to existing categories or instant or writing them inside of the respective texts he wrote them all on small pieces of paper and then he put a number in the corner uh it gets a lot more extensive than this but like this was the beginning of a system and then he collected them all in one place which he called the slip box and so he soon developed like new categories of these notes he realized that one idea one note was only as valuable as its context which was not necessarily the context it was taken from um and that's kind of where you get into like creativity and like coming up with new realizations is by you know combining unrelated you know pieces of uh discrete pieces of information and then relating them to each other and then having you know breakthroughs in your thoughts or your ideas um and so he started to think about how one idea could relate and contribute to different contexts uh just amassing notes in one place would not lead to anything other than a mass of notes which is what i'm currently dealing with um and it's not very helpful now that i've got you know 18 000 plus discrete pieces of information that i i'd like to return to but it's it's a mess um and so he collected his notes i'll wrap this up he collected his notes in this slip box in a way that the collection became much more than the sum of its parts uh his slip box became like he called it like he talked about it like his second brain or like a dialogue partner can i say a question is this obsolete due to today's technology i can see a lot of technical i mean does this still hold up today yeah so like um you know he yes there are people still using this as like an idea generator or a productivity generator and a lot of them have that they've been looking for and some people have even developed um um the softwares uh that that are designed to do this um some people uh i downloaded one uh gosh i can't remember what it's called uh i'll have to look i'll have to see if i can if i can find obsidian yes obsidian thank you so i downloaded obsidian for that purpose there are people who are still doing it uh like they swear by the note card system they have index cards and they yeah i think it's obsolete bro i gotta be honest you can just database this it's catalog it there's software that indexes this it makes it keyword searchable you can search thousands of terabytes of information just through a keyword that's why i mean would you say obsidian is that is that tool is that one of the the tool that's what he and carol uses that's what a lot of big brain guys that have a lot of notes and a lot of deep takes on a lot of complex topics different sources um i think obsidian is sort of designed it's like the modern day note card on steroids okay so yeah i mean there's software that effectively replaces no matter how effective this methodology is i can just say by modern technological standards i don't see how it could i don't know enough about it but i go down a limb and say that it'd be technologically obsolete just because when this was invented it was probably uh probably relatively ahead of its time but technology has advanced so much maybe there's some there's some things that could be adapted in terms of like your own file organization methodology uh note taking like method i suppose but in terms of just software enabling this on steroids i i think that it would it has to surpass anything manual just just by automation sense i i don't see any other well i and i i i think i agree i mean i agree with you because if you look if you there's a fairly healthy community of people you know communicating about this system and giving each other tips um you know i i i agree with you i think most of them know have have moved the system into some you know some some kind of digital form i bought a book uh that i can't recommend yet because i haven't read it i just got it last week because i'm i want to raise myself up at least some some some part of the way towards uh the kind of prodigious knowledge that carl displays and i i feel a little behind just because uh i don't i'm getting a late start on this stuff but i bought a book well you you don't read a book a day bro you're a f***ing slacker uh right now i'm aiming for a book a week so let's uh let's slow our roll a little bit um well it is about speed reading so the carl's technique is skimming and speed reading which is the only way to do it like i i don't read all chapters so if i want to read a book i'm i only read the chapters that i give a s*** about i think i'm too i think i'm too autistic to skim i've tried and it just it gives me anxiety uh i guess is the way i'd say it but maybe i can uh maybe i can level up and get on your level well because some chapters i don't care about i mean like listen guys write books and you have to fill the book up and you gotta like meet coota on your f***ing word count yeah and keep keep your paymasters happy i'll give a s*** about certain topics so there is a level of interest not every you know and that's the thing and you do listen there's only so much room in the meat computer okay right you can only shove so much f***ing s*** in it and you don't need to know everything like i just i focus on the s*** that i think matters personally but that's just me and that's objective i think i think one of my my big the big problems i i used to get criticized when i was a a young man and i was in college and even in high school because um i could write very fast and so i would sit in a lecture and i would basically record almost everything that the speaker said and i was told by my advisor on a number of occasions like you need to be sitting in this audience and um and you know ferreting out that which matters from that which doesn't and i just um i could never get myself off of the the completionist mindset i just have a i'm very autistically dedicated to like taking it all in which causes i mean you have a tape recorder bro you have your audio recorder i have definitely used uh surreptitiously tape recorders in many environments that the people who are on the other end of it would be i mean you can also use your phone i mean how old are you i'm 50 yeah you're a little bit pond times brother but listen that's okay that's okay uh i will i will drop the name of the book that i bought that i'm i'm looking into this uh because you know maybe maybe you're right maybe it's uh maybe this is past it's uh it's expiration date but i bought a book called how to take smart notes um by sonka arns uh son k e a h r e n s how to take smart notes by sonka arns and i'm gonna i'm gonna check this out and um i definitely am gonna dig into obsidian and just see what its its powers are but uh yeah i just i was gonna ask carl if he if he used any sort of system if he was familiar with with the zettel castin system the slip box or you know nicklas lumen and i would have be curious to ask him what software he runs but um we just never got there yeah yeah so what an awesome experience today to listen to him i made it sound like he might come back on again i i hope that that's the case because uh you know it was just such a such a wonderful experience to listen to somebody with such a depth of knowledge so um you know you get you know you can tune in in the in the morning in the early afternoon to 1488 radio and listen to carl rattle and then you can jump onto ht's uh live feed at night and and listen to him uh you know wind up uh you know young young kids who uh he's propagandizing into the movement so uh we just we we got it all here it's pretty great so i think i'll see the floor now thanks for uh thanks for taking my question";
